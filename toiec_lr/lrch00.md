#### Track 2 - Kay Singh

K: Open Bank, Kelly speaking. How may I help you?  
C: Hello, this is Kay Singh. I’m calling because I’ve been having some problems with my bank card.  
K: I’m sorry to hear that. What kind of problems?  
C: Well, every time I try to use it in a shop they have to swipe it three or four times before it works.  
K: I see. And is that the same for our ATMs?  
C: No, that seems to be OK for the moment.  
K: OK. Here is what I suggest. I’m going to order a new card straight away. It will take a few days before it arrives so in the meantime take the cash you think you’ll need from the ATM and I’ll give you a call as soon as the card is ready.

To swipe : glisser, passer la carte  
I've been having some problems*: present perfect continuous, retour sur une activité passée  
As soon as the card is ready : dans les subordonnées de temps on emploie le présent à la place du futur (= quand votre carte sera prête)

#### Track 3 - Cray Jones

C: This is Cray Jones from C.J. Butchers. I think we are going to have difficulties meeting our loan repayments this month.    
K: I see. Can you tell me what the problem is?  
C: One of our biggest customers hasn't paid his invoice for last month. He keeps promising to send a check but we haven't received it yet.  
K: Mmm. Don't worry. I can delay the payment so that you don't go overdrawn. Just give me a call when you get the check so that I can unblock the account. There might be a fee applied to your account but I can make sure you get that back at the end of the month. How does that sound?  
C:  Oh, that would be great. Thank you so much for your help.

a loan : un prêt  
repayments : les traites  
an invoice : une facture  
to block, unblock an account : bloquer, débloquer un compte  
A fee : des frais

#### Track 4 - Tara Epstein

K: Oh, is that Tara Epstein?  
C: That’s right.  
K: Oh, Hello Ms Epstein. This is Kelly Holmes from Open Bank. I’m calling about the email you sent me this morning.  I understand you want to make an international bank transfer.  
C: Yes. I’ve sent money from one state to another before and that seems to work just fine. But I need to send some money to my son in Europe and the website keeps blocking me.  
K: Ok. There is a function on the website to do that but you will need to enter a different customer code.  
C: Oh, I saw that and I thought it was just my usual customer ID.  
K: No, for international transfers we’ll need to make you a new one. So I can take care of that and send it to you through the post but it will take a couple of days to arrive. Alternatively, if you have the account details, we can do it together on the phone.  
C: OK, that will be perfect.  
K: OK. So first I’ll need to ask you some identification questions just to check.

a state : ici : un des 50 états des US  
ID : identification  
your account details : votre numéro de compte

#### Track 5

A. We’re conscious that we need to start to think about our retirement. What would you recommend?  

B. I’m thinking of making an MBA next year but I’m looking for a good way to invest my money in the meantime.  

C. Do you have any advice on how to invest on the stock market?  

D. We have found the perfect house to buy but we need to sell our place first and we haven’t even had a nibble yet.  

E. If we want to expand internationally, we’re going to need a big capital investment and I don’t see how we can raise that kind of money.  

F. I feel like my purchasing power is going down year on year. My salary has stayed the same but the prices in the supermarket have gone up by five per cent.  

G. If we want to be more competitive we really need to upgrade our computer systems but we just don’t have the money right now.

### Page 15 - Kristina Martins

#### Track 6

Good afternoon everyone. For those who I haven’t yet had the pleasure to meet, my name is Kristina Martin and over the last few weeks I’ve been working with the finance department to see what we can do about maximizing the money we spend and help the company move forwards. I’ve put together a little chart to show you where the money is going at the moment.

The first thing that should jump out at you is your fixed costs. That’s to say this office building, the mortgage repayments, insurance, electricity, air conditioning and so on. For most companies this would amount for about 25 percent of expenses and right now we are at thirty percent. I have a couple of suggestions on how to reduce that. The tenth and eleventh floors have large conference rooms that are only ever used once or twice a month and rarely at the same time. We could look into renting out one or both of these floors to another company without any change in the offices on the other floors. In other words we wouldn’t be forcing people to work in open space offices.

Labour costs account for the second largest expense and this goes hand in hand with production. As you are aware you are the only company in the industry that still produces all of your products in the US. I know that you have chosen to keep the company one hundred percent American and I respect that. There are tax breaks available at the moment that are made for companies who help keep unemployment low. I’ve started to look into this and I think we have a real case to make that we comply with the regulations.

The first thing that surprised me when you contacted me was how little brand name recognition you have. The products are of a very high standard, which justifies the prices you choose but nobody can sell high quality products if the brand isn’t well known.

If we can cut five percent off our fixed costs and another seven or eight percent off labour costs and production my suggestion would be to give at least half of that over to marketing. You’d still be lowering expenses but with well-targeted campaigns you could make a significant difference to sales as well as profits, which is after all the bottom line.

#### Track 12 - Choosing a hotel

1  
M: This hotel looks really nice !  
W: That's probably why it costs an arm and a leg! Let's try to stick more or less to budget.  
2  
W: Does the hotel have a car park?  
M: No, but they have valet parking which I think is better.  
3  
W1: We were thinking of trying this hotel by the beach.  
W2: I know, it looks nice, but it's got terrible reviews.  
4  
M: How about this hotel for our weekend away?  
W: Mmmm, isn't there anywhere slightly closer to the centre of town?  
5  
W: What do you think of the hotel next to the conference center?  
M: The room was ok, but the restaurant was to die for!  
6  
M: I hope they have king-size beds.  
W: I know, and with a decent mattress, and fresh seats too!  
7  
W1: Is there anything worth visiting in this area?  
W2: Who cares when you've got a gym, and a swimming-pool, and a sauna!  
8  
M: Did you like the hotel I recommended ?  
W: They were so friendly. They really bent over backwards to make our stay just perfect.



### Page 27 - Checking out a website

#### Track 13 - Cathy Brookes

C : So we're planning to drive from Atlanta to New York and we want to know how much the drop-off charge will be.  
H : OK. I can see from your account that you're planning on renting a sedan.  
C : That's right. Does that make a difference?  
H : Well, yes it does. Our sedans typically have mileage limited to five hundred miles per week. And Atlanta to New York is nearly nine hundred miles. But if you upgrade to a saloon, there's unlimited mileage. On top of that there wouldn't be a drop off charge. So it'll cost 10$ extra a day for the car but you'll be more than getting that back with the savings.  
C : And we get a more comfortable ride ! Sounds good to me. 

#### Track 14 - Joe Forken

H : How can I help you?  
C : I ordered a roadster because I thought it would be fun to run a road trip through Arizona but the car won't start. I've turned the key a hundred times but nothing happens.  
H : OK. All our roadsters are automatics. Have you driven one before?  
C: No. This is my first time. But I know the basics. You put it into Drive and press on the accelerator, right?  
H : That's true. But you'll need to press on the brake before you turn on the engine. It's a safety feature. Are you in the car right now?  
C : Yes. Oh, it works!  
H : Excellent! My advice is, don't go too fast for the first couple of hours and stick to Drive and Park only. It's not so difficult but it can take a while to get used to  
C : OK. We'll do. And thanks!

#### Track 15 - Tara Curran

H : Hi there, how was the trip?  
C : Well, the trip went fine but we had a problem with an iron gate at the entrance to our cottage.  
H : Oh, I see. You have a nasty scratch down the wing. Did you sign up to our extra insurance?  
C : I'm not sure. I don't think so. That's going to be really expensive, isn't it?  
H : Let me check for you. Oh I see you are in our Gold Membership Program and this was your free rental. Well I can still swap the free rental for free insurance. That means you'll have to pay for the car for the last few days but the damage is covered.  
C : Is that a better deal?  
H : Well, a hatchback for four days is two hundred dollars and the repairs to a scratched wing would likely cost over one thousand dollars.  
C : I think we might follow your advice on that one.

#### Track 17 - Destinations

There are of course many destinations for travelers in Europe. Italy for instance is a treasure trove of beautiful cities and fabulous monuments. Further east, Budapest is a great city with a mixture of Celtic and Roman architecture. 

For those looking for something more off the beaten track, there is a charming city in the Czech Republic which is relatively unknown. It has authentic cobblestone streets, baroque churches. It's like a smaller version of Prague except that it isn't round packed with tourists.  

If you're looking for something further flung, the natural landscape of Bolivia is virtually untouched by hordes of tourists.

If you want massive skyscrapers in the middle of the desert, then Qatar is surprisingly impressive and offers much more in the way of fun and culture than most people imagine.

My tip however might be the Azores which is like a Hollywood movie set with its volcanic islands full of greenery and beautiful lakes. If you like nature, it's got more to offer than almost anywhere else.

Otherwise in terms of absolute beauty Iceland has some of the most breathtaking landscapes. You might think it would be the least summer destination but few would regret seeing the glaciers and the skylines or waterfalls on offer.

#### Track 22 - conversation 1

W: I can’t believe we have so much stuff ! It’s just as well we are moving to a bigger house.  
M: I know. But I really think we could have taken the opportunity to get rid of some of our junk.  
W: Hey! If you get to keep your ugly armchair I can have my porcelain collection. That was the deal.

#### Track 23 - conversation 2

M: So we’ve built the outer wall which is this one here and we are going to start with the interiors next.  
W: So that’s the kitchen there. Is that going to be big enough for our three food cookers?  
M: Don’t worry. The rooms always look smaller on the plans.

big enough : assez grand  ≠ enough money : assez d'argent  
a cooker : une cuisinière. a steam cooker : un cuit-vapeur  

#### Track 24 - conversation 3

W: This is the third house I was talking about. Do you want to take a look around inside?  
M: Sure ! It looks a bit bigger than the others. I hope it fits into our budget.  
W: Well the owners are anxious to sell quickly. Have a look around and we can talk finances after.

take a look around : faire le tour, visiter, jeter un coup d’oeil  
it fits into our budget : elle rentre dans notre budget  
anxious : ici, pressés 

#### Track 25 - conversation 4

W: Is that going to be ready for the client meeting this afternoon?  
M: It’ll be touch and go. I didn’t have time to work on it yesterday so I’ve had to rush it this morning.  
W: So long as the glue dries on time we should be OK.

touch and go : très serré, pas gagné d'avance  
I’ve had to rush it : j'ai dû faire vite

#### Track 26 - Lisa

I’ve been working for a few years now and I have enough money for a down payment. I’ve spoken to the bank. Apparently a five hundred thousand dollar mortgage is going to come out at more or less the same cost as the rent on my current apartment. The rates are really low so I have to get in now before they start to go up. I think I’m going to go for it.

I’ve been working for a few years now : ça fait maintenant quelques années que je travaille  
current : actuel (ici)  
I'm going to go for it : je vais me lancer  

#### Track 27 - Greg

Greg: I’m seriously considering getting a condo. I’m not really interested in working in the yard, spending my weekends checking the gutters or painting the walls plus it’s a good first step on the housing market. And I’ve been throwing money out of the window for the last few years on rent.

the yard : le jardin  
gutters : les gouttières  
to throw, threw, thrown : lancer, jeter

#### Track 28 - Kamara

I think it’s too early for me to lay down roots. I don’t know what I’m going to be doing in two years’ time. If I buy now, I’m going to barely get my money back if I have to sell a couple of years down the road. If I can find a cheap place to rent, that gives me more possibilities if I want to move on. If I’m offered a job across the country, I can leave at the drop of a hat.

lay down roots : m'enraciner  
barely : à peine, tout juste  
a couple of years down the road : d'ici quelques années  
move on : évoluer  
if I’m offered : si on m'offre (passif, be +Vpp)  
across the country, : à l'autre bout du pays  
leave, left, left : quitter, partir  
at the drop of a hat : comme bon me semble, à tout moment

a condo (condominium ) ≠ an apartment  
a detached, semi-detached, terraced house  
an owner, a tenant  
common areas

M: We really need to move !  
W: You’re telling me ! Those kids upstairs spend all day running around and shouting.  
B  
W: I think I may have to put on another layer of clothing.  
M:  I could turn the radiators up. But it’s already costing us an arm and a leg.  
C  
M: We should look into buying. The rent keeps going up every month.  
W: Then you’d start worrying about the mortgage. I know two people who’ve had their houses repossessed.  
D  
W: I’m not going another day without hot water.  
M: I’ll call Mr Stokes again. But I think he’s been screening his calls.  
E  
M: I’m glad I’m not a tenant any more. Have you thought about buying?  
W: I’ve thought about it but I don’t want to leave the city and that’s out of my price range.  
F  
W: Bob, it’s raining. There’s water coming through the roof !  
M: I thought we’d fixed that. I’m going to have to pay for someone to come by and look at it again.  
G  
M: This place is big enough for the two of us.  
W: I suppose so. But if there were three of us, we might find it a bit poky.

### Page 47 - Heloise Clarke, project manager

#### Track 30

Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being here. I’m going to give you an overview of the project: what types of properties we’re offering, as well as the services and amenities. After that I’ll pass you over to Alan who can take you through the finer points of the financing of the project.

So, here you can see the plans for the new property development. Work is scheduled to begin at the beginning of next month and delivery all being well should be in two years’ time. As you can see it’s a low-rise project, just four storeys and each floor has three flats.

The ground floor flats each have a private rear garden. The first and second floor flats have large balconies on two sides and the top floor flats each have access to private roof terraces.

The flats have been designed with two basic layouts. They all have three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living-room but some of them come with a fully fitted kitchen while others have just a small kitchen area with a sink, a fridge, a microwave and a worktop. Our research has shown that about  fifty percent of londoners don’t have time to cook and prefer somewhere where they can prepare a salad, eat up a dish and wash a plate or a glass. The rest of the time they eat out or they get a take-out.  And so they prefer to maximize their living space instead of giving over[^] space to a kitchen they have no use for. 

On the other hand we know that families particularly those with young children require a kitchen and so we are aiming to offer a property with something for everyone. In term of services each flat comes with a parking space in our underground garage. We have security cameras and personnel regularly doing rounds to ensure the safety of our residence.  

Adjacent to the parking garage will be a gym with exercise equipment exclusively for residents with trained fitness instructors available in the morning, early afternoon and at weekends.

In terms of location we are close enough to the town centre for it to be walkable but far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle of a city centre. For those with children it’s about a five-minute drive to the local primary schools and there are buses that will take you to the secondary schools in about twenty minutes.

So that’s the two different types of properties, of services and amenities. I’ll pass you over now to Alan to talk to you about finance.

*KC: So, What can I do for you Stan?  
SP: I was wondering if we could dip into the training budget.  
KC: I don't see why not. What kind of training are you looking for?

### Track 36 - Katia Chandler

*OK. Thanks for coming everyone. I'd just like to take you through some of the projects that we're going to be running in HR this year. I'll try to keep this brief but there is quite a lot to get through so if you'll bear with me I'll give you time to ask questions at the end.*

*Right. First of all we have finally fixed a limit to this year's training budget. As you know we have decided to work with just one service provider for training. So we're holding a tender to try to find the best price and conditions we can get. I think it's fair to say we've all been a little bit underwhelmed by the training services over the last few years which is why there's been so much chopping and changing, so this time we're prepared to pay a little bit more to get a more serious firm in the hope we can build a relationship over the next four to five years.*

*On a similar note if we want the training to be effective we need all of our employees to be present at the training sessions. There's been far too much absenteeism in the past and some of that is due to managers not freeing up their staff for the sessions. It is a requirement of the firm for training to be held within working hours and timetables are set a long time in advance. We really need absolute last-minute emergencies for employees not to be able to attend, so I'm counting on you to cascade that information to your teams.*

*OK. So other than training we are launching this month our LinkedIn program. I'm quite excited about this because as a firm that has invested a lot in technology I think it's vital that we acknowledge the changing nature of the world and particularly the power of social media. We're going to need photos and profiles for every member of staff which will be part of our global community. This project has already started in our offices across the pond so we need to get moving on this too in the coming weeks.*

*Finally we have made the decision to really invest in green projects this year.  So we are going to become completely paper-free. That means that all printers and photocopiers will be removed except for the main copier on the thirty-thirst floor which will be accessed with a password. It is reserved for executives. Too many emails, personal documents and Powerpoint presentations are being printed when they could be just as easily viewed on screen. In today's age that is just not acceptable.*

*In HR we are going to be playing our part and all pay slips, tax documents and annual leave request forms are going to be made available digitally. We have been working with IT to have this ready by the end of this quarter and each employee will have a login and password with which they'll be able to access the site and see how much leave they have taken, request extra days, see their pay slips and so on. Pay slips will also be emailed to each employee at the email address they enter in their personal profile on the site. In other words if at any time they wish to change the email address they can do this through the site but we'll be going to go through the procedures for this once we are ready to go live.*

*So, that's the training, the new LinkedIn program and the green projects covered. So if you have any questions about any of that, I'll be happy to answer them now.*

### Page 59 - Logistics

####  Track 40 - Interview of Johnny Harris 

IN: How do you manage a global logistics strategy?

JH: The first thing to keep in mind is that you can’t have the same strategy in each geographic region. For example, in the last ten years there has been some real growth in logistics in Western Europe. But that pales into insignificance when you compare it to Eastern Europe. A good example is the automotive industry where most major car manufacturers have opened a plant in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland. They have the advantage of having lower labor costs. But crucially they are closer to the target market. We have been involved from the beginning in setting up the plants to integrate our logistics strategy.  

IN: You have talked a lot in the past about a door-to-door service. What do you mean by that exactly?  

JH: A good example is a service we run for a company in Spain. They have two plants : one in Malaga, the other in Granada. We take the raw materials at the two plants in Spain and transport them overseas to Freetown in Sierra Leone. They then have to be taken more than five thousand kilometers to Brazil where the finishing touches to the products are added. We then take the products back along the same route to Spain. That means that the same containers are in transit all the time. We take care of all the customs formalities at each port. So we guarantee every step of the operation, which for our client means reduced transit times and little to no lost product.   

IN: How easy is it to guarantee deadlines?

JH: It’s not easy at all. We set targets per region and per product and we try to stick to them as much as possible. One solution that we have pioneered in the UK is our eighteen eight rule. That means for all urgent deliveries if your order is placed before six pm, or eighteen hundred hours, we guarantee you will receive it by eight o’clock the next day. Of course for that to work companies must be on site to receive the products or the components before eight am. 

#### Vocabulary

The automotive industry: le secteur automobile  
A car manufacturer : un constructeur automobile  
we have been involved from the beginning : nous sommes impliqués depuis le début  
to run a service : faire fonctionner, offrir un service...  
raw materials: la matière première. Un peu étrange dans ce contexte.  
customs formalities : les formalités douanières  
every step : chaque étape  
to set a target : fixet un objectif (a target = une cible)  
components : les composants

#### Grammar: present perfect

Present perfect : have opened (pas de date), have been involved since (depuis), have talked in the past, one solution we have pioneered (action accomplie, pas de date)

### Page 61 - Describing a production process

#### Track 41 - Ron and Jill Wardley produce olive oil.

RW: We started making oil about ten years ago, didn't we Jill?  
JW: Yes. It was the year after we bought the olive grove. So we had about ten olive trees before that and that gave us another fifty or so.  
RW: The production method is quite simple. At first we lay down nets to catch the olives that fall.  
JW: We use an electric shaker to pick them now, but when we started we did it all by hand which took a lot longer.  
RW: I don't miss doing that. After that we gather up the nets and empty them into big plastic crates.  Depending on the year we might have anything between twenty and forty crates stocked in our garage.  
JW: Thirty seven this year I think, about nine hundred kilos in all. It took us five trips to take them all off to the mill.  
RW: So next we tip all of the olives into a hopper and a little mechanical bridge carries them up to be washed.  
JW: Then once they're clean we drop them into a tray. After that they are funneled into bins, which malaxes them  and turns them for an hour.   
RW: The malaxer effectively turns them into a brown paste, which makes you wonder whether this is what you wanted or not.  
JW: But the mill moves them along into a massive centrifuge.  
RW: And then it produces perfect organic extra virgin olive oil.  
JW: We had about a hundred and fifty liters this year. Some we keep. We give some to the family and we sell the rest. It's a lot of work but it's worth it.

#### T48 - Dr Turner gives advice to Inessa

D: How’s your leg feeling, Inessa?  
I: It’s feeling a bit better but it’s still quite stiff.
D: I see. It may be it isn’t used enough. Why don’t you try some cycling?  
I: Last time we met you told me to do some exercise. So I have. I walk to work, I’ve done some light exercises even.  
D: That may be the problem. It’s not really recommended to do any exercise that puts too much stress on the joints.  
I: Oh, so cycling is the only sport I can do?  
D: No, that was my advice. But if you prefer, you could do some stretching exercises. Some people say that yoga can be very good for stiff joints.  
I: That all takes time that I don’t really have. Isn’t there some cream or gel that I can buy instead?  
D: Well, there are many types of over-the-counter products but that’s not really my specialty. I rally think that simple non stressful exercise is the best thing for you.

1. Doctor Turner **suggests she try** cycling (subjonctif, pas de -s).

2. Inessa says he **advised her to do** some exercise so she has

3. He doesn’t **recommend she put** too much stress on the joints.

4. He **advises her to go** to a yoga class for stretching exercises.

### Page 82 - Present Perfect 2

#### Grammar Corner 1

Cette leçon présente des cas où on doit employer le present perfect et non le prétérit.

"unfinished periode of time" = une période qui va jusqu'au moment présent.  
"unfinished actions" :  dans ce cas le français emploie le présent.  
"unfinished negative actions" : traduction an passé ou au présent

#### Find the mistake

1  
The company *has had* offices in the UK ten years ago : impossible, avec ago on doit utiliser le prétérit. Deux possibilités :  

1. The company had offices in the UK ten years ago : il y a dix ans, la société avait des bureaux au Royaume-Uni.
2. **The company has had offices in the UK for ten years** : cela fait dix ans que la société a des bureaux au Royaume-Uni, la société a des bureaux au Royaume-Uni depuis 10 ans.

2  
We *haven't had* a serious company strategy when I joined the firm. Même impossibilité avec when qu'avec ago, les deux renvoient l'action dans le passé.:

1. **We didn't have a serious company strategy when I joined the firm**: nous n'avions pas… mais cela a pu changer.
2. **We haven't had a serious company strategy since I joined the firm** : dempuis que j'ai rejoint l'entreprise, nous n'avons jamais eu...

3  
The R&D departement has wanted extra investment for years now : OK, cela fait maintenant des années que le service recherche et développement veut...

4  
Even our most committed (dévoués, investis) employees *hasn't* always followed the company strategy: temps correct ("always" = unfinished period of time) mais employees est un pluriel:  
**Even our most committed employees haven't always followed…**

5  
Our share price wen down three times this week. Correct en anglais américain. En anglais britannique, on doit employer le present perfect avec this week (unfinished period of time):   
**our share price has gone down three times this week.**

6 The CEO *has sent a message* last night : avec last night (finished period of time), on emploie le prétérit:  
**The CEO sent a message last night**



### Page 83 - Company Strategy

#### Vocabulary to revise

to cut costs: réduire les coût  
to borrow money (from): emprunter de l'argent  
to rebrand: donner un nouvelle image (relooker…)  
a brand : une marque  
to merge with: fusionner  
to gain market share : gagner des parts de marché (comparer avec : to earn, to win)

to focus on : se concentrer sur  
our core market : notre marché principal

a redundancy plan : un plan social (de licenciements)  
tricky : délicat, complexe  

#### Track 53 - Giving advice on company strategy

A 2  
M: I've been talking to the bank about raising money through selling bonds. That way we could really think about attacking the Asian market.  
W: That's all right if it works. What happens if it doesn't work out? We'd be taking a big risk.

B 8  
W1: We have a really good product but we haven't managed to penetrate in the way we thought we would.  
W2: I've been saying for ages that the only thing this company is lacking is a strong advertising campaign. We're just not as well known as our competitors.

C 1  
M: We're going to have to drastically reduce our expenses. The board keep asking about our stock price *(le prix de nos actions)*.  
W: Tell them we need to have a long-term strategy. Short term gains will seriously impact on employee commitment.

D 4  
W: If we merge with Data Systems we'll get their server knowhow which would really make a difference to our cloud software solutions.  
M: That's not a bad idea. It would be mutually beneficial.

E 3  
W1: Have you heard about the rebranding the board is suggesting?  
M: You mean the name change? It would distance us from the bad publicity we got last year but it would take some getting used to *(publicity ≠ advertising)*.

F 7  
M: With the the exchange rate the way it is, we're hardly making any profits from our overseas operations.  
W: And we're losing market share at home. I think we need to pull out from Europe and focus on our core market.

G 5  
W: We're doing Due Diligence on Free Time. If it looks workable and we can keep their customer base  it will realy increase our market share.  
M: Be careful. If this leads to a massive redundancy plan, people won't be happy and it will be tricky and expensive.

H 6  
M: Our market study shows that customers are mostly unhappy with our hotline operators. They say they are rude and condescending.   
W: I know. We really should put some training across the board on handling client complaints and delivering friendly helpful customer service.

#### Filling the gaps in a text

When Bright Sparks was founded **in** 1987 *(cas 1, months, years)*, their strategy was very simple. They wanted to become a national player **by** the end of the century *(cas 2, deadline, date limite, échéance)*. In fact, they reached that goal *(but)* **in** 1988, with over than 30% of market share in the UK. **At** that time in their development *(cas 1)* they hadn't thought further ahead *(pas poussé la réflexion)*. An executive meeting was called **in** Spetember of that year to set new goals and objectives. Those goals changed  **over** the next decade *(cas 3: extended periode of time)* as the company went from strength to strength *(strength: la force, un point fort)* to become the worldwide leader **by** the  end of the century *(cas 2: deadline)*.

FR: Jacqueline, this is Farrah Read from Totally Travel. Do you have a minute?  
JS: Of course. Did I hear you say Totally Travel? So you did agree to change the name of the company.   
FR: It was one of the conditions of the merger but it's growing on me *(je m'y fais bien)*.  
JS: So what's new?  
FR: Well, my role for a start. It's not so easy to run a company when you have two CEOs. It feels like one of us is going to get the bullet any minute now.  
JS: Oh, I won't lie to you. It's really a long-term solution but there are some companies who have managed it successfully. You need to set out clear guidelines on the direction you're planning to take the company in.

#### Track 55 - Matthiew Rice

JS: Mathiew, this is Jacqueline Smith returning your call. How are things at Global Farmers?  
MR: Oh, hi Jacqueline. Thanks for getting back to me. To be honest, the answer to your question is not great. Patents are running out. The FDA are taking for ever on clinical trials. We are looking at having to make cuts again this quarter. It'st not doing wonders for company morale.  
JS: I see. So do you have products in the pipeline?  
MR: Several. But it might be months before we can go to market.  
JS: OK. So you're right about company morale. So you want to be careful about how you move forward. If you start imposing cuts you're going to be in for trouble and it will do nothing for your value on Wall Street.  
MR: So what do you suggest?  
JS: Speak to the board and tell them they might have to take a short-term loss to make a long-term gain. Once those products become available in six months, you'll be fine. Work out your most likely forecast for the next twelve months and give the something to think about. At the same time, brief your heads of departments  on the same thing. If you can stick together, you'll get through it. Let's get together this week to work on your presentation. That will give us a clear idea of what we are dealing with.  
MR: And you think that will work?  
JS: It's not a sure thing but I think it's your best plan of action.

*Patents: les brevets

#### Track 56 - Sarah Fields

SF: Jacqueline, this is Sarah Fields from Real Properties. Did you get my email?  
JS: I was just about to reply. I understand you're thinking about making an offer to buy York Estates.  
SF: Exactly. I want to put the idea to the board next week. I was wondering if you had any thoughts.  
JS: I've done a little bit of digging. They seem to have a solid financial basis.  Their coverage is quite small but they do fill in some of the gaps in your network.  
SF: So, you think we should go for it.  
JS: Well, essentially you're looking at a horizontal merger. That's to say you both work in the same market. There's nothing wrong with that but I wonder if that's the best move for you right now. If you want to really grow the business, you might want to look at something more vertical.  
SF: I'm getting you have somehing in mind.  
JS: Well, a little birdie told me that McGrath are looking for an investor.  
SF: McGrath? Don't they deal with office building?  
JS: They do, and they're good at it.  The brand is strong, they have a good network and they might be open to a merger. That gives you a hold on both sides of the real estate market. Have a think about it. If you want, I can get one of my guys to start doing diligence on them.  
SF: Ok, do that. But can you do the same on York, in case it doesn't work out?  
JS: No problem. Let's stay in touch.

#### Track 57 Kate and James

J: Hi Kate! Is it true that you're the one who thought up the new concierge service?  
K: Oh, Hi James! Yes, it's an idea I got from a company I used to work for.  
J: So, How does it work exactly?  
K: Well, they offer all sorts of services. They can do your dry cleaning, organise your business or your personal travel, make reservations in restaurants, anything you need really.  
J: And that's all free?  
K: For the employees, yes. For the company it's an expense but it's considered to be cost-effective in the long run.  
J: It's certainly true that with my work hours I don't have a lot of time to take care of my personal life.   
K: That's the whole point. You can forget the stress of trying to cram everything in and concentrate on your work. That's good for us and good for you. It's all about employee satisfaction.  
J: I thought that employee satisfaction came from the job itself.  
K: It does, but there are lots of companies where you could do the same job but not every company offers the extra things we do, it makes us stand out.  
J: but if you use the money from the concierge service to increase our salaries, wouldn't that have the same effect?  
K: Not according to the research. People often complain about salary but that's just human nature. We always want more. If companies want to retain their talent, money alone is never enough.  
J: I suppose the question is, how do you measure it? How do you know if people have more job satisfaction or not?  
K: We do audits. We try to gauge how people feel about their jobs before and after new innovations but the reality is in what we see. If people choose to stay and invest in the company we see that in their attitude to work. If people start looking for other jobs we think about what we can do differently.  
J: That makes sense, I plan to take advantage of it in any case.
