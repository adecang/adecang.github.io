Chinese autorities have confirmed that a new virus spreading across the country can be passed from person to person. The disease has infected more than two hundred people and and three have died since it was discovered in the central city of Wu Han last month. Cases have now been reported in Bei Jing and several other major coastal cities and provinces. Our medical correspondent Fergus Walsh reports.

It's official. Chinese new mysterious virus can pass from person to person. almost all of the cases so far have been the result of close contact with animals. The source is thought to be a seafood market in the city of Wu Han where the outbreak is centered. But Chinese National Health Commission has confirmed there has been a small number of cases of human to human transmission. Some medical staff are said to have been infected. Heatlth authorities in China are urging the public not to panic as hundreds of millions prepare to travel to celebrate the lunar new year. It's inevitable that this will lead to a further surge in cases.

The infection is caused by a coronavirus and causes respiratory problems, fever and cough. It's the height of the flu sason meaning that it's hard to know initially what infection patients have. At train stations and airports in China, body temperature scanners are being used. some airports in the United States, Singapore and Japan are screening travelers. Professor Jimmy Whitworth from the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine  says that may eventually need to happen here.

*Professor Jimmy  Whitworth*: 'The UK authorities need to start thinking about introducing some screening for passengers who are coming from China. The most obvious thing to do would be to institute some sort of formal screening so that we identify people who've got fever. But that could be supplemented with some questionnaires.'

This will revive painful memories from SARS also caused by a coronavirus which killed nearly eight hundred people worldwide almost two decades ago. That outbreak, initially covered up by China, was eventually brought under control by isolating patients and through international cooperation. Global health officials say China has learnt from past mistakes but it may be weeks or months yet before we know how big a threat this new virus poses.
