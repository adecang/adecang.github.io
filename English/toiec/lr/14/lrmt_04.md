#### Talk 1 - a voice message

Hello Mr Freestone, this is Mary Etienne from Dotcom Repairs. We've had a look at your laptop and the problem appears to be the graphic card. We don't have any in stock that go with your model, but if you want we can order one. They normally cost around fifty dollars and as we discussed we charge fifty dollars for repairs. If you would like to go ahead with that, give us a call to let us know. It doesn't generally take more than a day to get spare parts, so if you choose that option it should be ready by the weekend.

    B: An IT director  
    **C: A computer store employee**

    **A: They don't have an item in stock**  
    B: The computer graphics are faulty (= l'affichage)  
    C: The cost is very high  
    D: The screen is broken
19. When does she think it will be ready?  
    A: After the weekend  
    B: On the weekend  
    **C: Before the weekend**  
    D: In two weeks

Ok everyone. I want to walk you through the procedure for the new sales software we're migrating onto for the 1st of next month. You should all have received an email with a link to our internet website. if you click on the link, it will take you to a page with the download of the new software. You'll have to activate popups on the web page and it will take about fifty minutes in total. I don't really foresee any problems as it's virtually idiot-proof, but Sonia and I in IT are on hand if needs be. Otherwise, don't forget we are not to start using this software before the beginning of next month.
