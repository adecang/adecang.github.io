**Question A**
<details>
<summary>
You know what I've been meaning to ask you. Have you heard from John lately? I was wondering if the move went ok.
</summary>
<br/>
Apparently the move went very well. It's a little different to being in the city but they've bought a boat, would you believe it. And Alice has settled down well in her new school, so I think they're all going fine.
<i>
	<br/>lately: récemment, ces temps dernier
	<br/>the move: le déménagement
	<br/>to settle: s'installer, trouver ses marques
</i>
</details>

**Question B**
<details>
<summary>
Ron, you came by car. How was the drive over today?
</summary>
<br/>
Well, the I-95 was ram-packed. There must have been a pile up I think because it was just solid. We turned off a couple of exits early and it wasn't so bad in town. Anyway, we still got here on time.
<i>
	<br/>The I-95: interstate 95, l'autoroute la plus connue des US, 3000km de la Floride au Canada.

**Question D**
<details>
<summary>
Have you seen the teachers on strike again? It seems it's every other week at the moment.</summary>
</details>
<br/>

**Question E**
<details>
<summary>
We've had to take our winter coats out of storage. It has been such rotten weather lately.
</summary>
<br/>
Yes, it's been absolutely freezing recently, hasn't it? And it's been so sudden. We were in the garden last weekend but since Monday it must have dropped ten degrees.
<i>
	<br/>We've had to: nous avons dû: accompli, pas de date, present perfect
	<br/>rotten: pourri (sens propre et figuré)

<summary>
Your oldest must be eleven by now. How is he settling into his new school?
</summary>
</details>
<br/>

**Question G**
<details>
<summary>
I see you're drinking the Beaujolais. What do you think of it?
</summary>
<br/>
I was just saying to Ann, it's rather nice. Quite fresh, but a bit fruity as well. I'm normally more of a white man myself, the red generally goes to my head but I'm not driving tonight so I thought why not.
<i>
	<br/>I'm normally more of a white man myself: je suis plutôt blanc, je préfère le blanc (vin)
	<br/>the red goes to my head: le rouge me monte à la tête
</i>
</details>
<br/>

**Question H**
<details>
<summary>
Is that new? That's a lovely dress you're wearing. It really suits you.
</summary>
<br/>
Really? Well, thank you very much. I did um and ah a bit in the shop before I bought it because it's not my usual style, but when you're invited to a party it's nice to go for something a little different, isn't it?
<i>
	<br/>it suits you: elle te va bien
	<br/>I did um and ah = j'ai pas mal hésité
	<br/> go for something a little different: choisir quelque chose qui change

### Track 79 - Abbie

I'm not much of a theatre goer. The last play I saw went on for about four hours and the seats weren't that comfortable either. Movies tend to be shorter than that and the Great Oak has comfortable seats. We can fall asleep if the movie's not that good. I'd have to see the trailers first. But I think *All alone* is likely to be more my type of movie. Apparently Bradley Jones has a cameo in that.

*a theatre goer: un amateur de théatre  
the seats weren't **that** comfortable: les sièges n'étaient pas si ccomfortables que ça  
a trailer: une bande annonce  
he has a cameo in that: il fait une apparition dans ce film (souvent un acteur célèbre, non crédité au générique, mentionné par "avec la participation de")*
