You could say that I'm the one working behind the screen. Literally, in some cases. A lot of people don't know, don't care what is happening inside the computer and certainly don't know the difference between a PCI and a CPU. That is, until it breaks down, that's where I come in.

My work involves the design of new models. Do people want a more compact model, or a bigger screen? How do we give people more power and the same autonomy? What will stand out in one of the most competitive industries in the world? I have to be able to answer those questions and come up with something that meets those requirements.

Almost every electronic product on the market today uses silicon wafers. The technology requires a dust-free environment where robots move these tiny fragile slices along the production line to become parts of computers, smartphones and TVs. And we, the workers, wear white bunny suits to cut down the risks of contamination.

I'd get nowhere without my phone. You might as well ask me to leave a limb at home. It's my watch, my dictionary, my encyclopeadia, my payment card, my window on the world and my way of finding my way around town. And failing that, calling an Uber. And when its battery runs low, I care for it like a sick child.

My mobile is just a phone. I don't ever touch screen, it does'nt have a web browser or three million apps. If I want to send a text message, I have to press '1' three times to get a C. It can last for days without needing recharging and the sound quality is just fine most of the time. I don't need it to do any more than that.

<strong>Talk 6</strong>
In my job I need to have two screens. As a graphic designer I might be editing a photo on one screen that I need to put into a diagram on the second screen. It reduces the risk of passing over things by not being able to see all of the project at the same time.
