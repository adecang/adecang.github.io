I started my social media consultancy  business from scratch at the age of 17, selling targeted advertising  space on social media sites like Facebook. Four years later, it’s a  multimillion-pound business and I earn a five-figure sum every month,  but I’m still young – and I want to have as much fun as I can and see  what the world has to offer. So I usually take a couple of weeks off  work every month and go abroad.

I prefer to travel by private jet because you can rock up at the  airport 10 minutes before the flight. There’s no queuing and you get  driven right from the plane door to immigration. I must save at least  six hours of my time per round trip. That’s important to me, because I  tend to work incredibly hard when I’m not on holiday, typically putting  in a 10- to 15-hour day.

I must have taken 45 or 50 flights in the past year to 30 different  places. I like to go skiing or visit Paris, Milan and new places – I  love immersing myself in new cultures. I don’t own my own jet; I pay for a membership service that enables me to get seats on private charters. I see the expense as cost-neutral because I often meet other CEOs and  business leaders onboard. We’ll have a friendly conversation, build up a relationship and end up doing business together. I reckon I’ve drummed  up around £250,000 of work for my business over the last few months,  just by taking private jets.

I’ll usually stay in a hotel that costs £200 to £800 a night or in  the summer I’ll charter a boat for £1,000 to £2,000 a day. I want to  experience the best things in life. The service you get when you pay  that kind of money is immaculate and the food you eat is delicious.  I like eating out most days. I think I only cooked one meal last week. I must spend about £300 to £500 a week on food, maybe more.

As a treat, last year, I flew my mum to Scotland on a private jet and took her to a spa. She loved that.

Home is a three-bed apartment on the cliffs near Poole in Dorset. I  live alone, except for my English springer spaniel, Charlie. I must  spend £200 to £300 a month on her. When I take her on a walk to my local pub, I’ll buy her a cooked steak – no sauce.

I’ve got a six-figure sum invested in cryptocurrencies, and it’s not  uncommon for me to make around £1,000 overnight. I’ve made around  £60,000 to £70,000 in total although I lost £7,000 recently when bitcoin fell back.

I have two buy-to-let properties I own which pay my mortgage, and I’m about to take on a third one. And I do guaranteed rentals; I rent, say, a three-bed home and pay £1,500 a month to the landlord guaranteed for  five years, then I make it an HMO (house of multiple occupation) doing  things like changing the lounge into a bedroom and earning more than the £1,500 rent.

Recently, I bought a £12,000 jet ski. I also bought a £70,000  Porsche. I traded in another car I owned to get the Porsche, so it  actually only cost me about £10,000 upfront. I enjoy driving, the  business is going well and I’ve always aspired to own nice things so I  thought: why not? Just three years ago, I didn’t have a penny to my name and now I can walk into a dealership and buy an iconic fast car  outright. That feels good.

I still appreciate the value of money. I’m a young entrepreneur, and  I’ve worked hard for everything I’ve earned – nobody gave me the money  to start my business. But I don’t believe in just working, working,  working to earn money. I can’t buy myself time and the more money I  make, the more I want to maximise my time on this planet. In my opinion, that is money well spent.
