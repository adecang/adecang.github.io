I will start the new year £76,000 in debt. I owe more than £37,000 on four different credit cards, have taken out a £37,000 loan and maxed  out my £2,000 overdraft. For a long time I’ve been in denial about my  financial circumstances, but recently I signed a debt management plan to try to sort it out. It is a scary situation to be in and signing the  plan was terrifying, but I hope it will only be temporary.

Eighteen months ago, I was debt-free. I started living on credit  because that was the only way I could afford to set up the social  enterprise I run in my spare time. It’s called PressPad and it matches  established journalists who have a spare room and live in a big city,  such as London, with media interns who live outside that city.

I spend between £300 and £500 a month running it, but setting it up  has cost me tens of thousands of pounds, which I didn’t anticipate. It  all happened very quickly – I soon realised that if I didn’t invest my  own money, it would be difficult to scale the project and get potential  sponsors to take it seriously. Now I lie awake at night, sometimes,  worrying about how much debt I am in. But I do think it has been worth  it.

The idea behind PressPad is to diversify the media by providing  aspiring journalists with subsidised accommodation and mentorship,  lowering the financial barrier of entry into journalism. I also hope it  will rewire networks of people so that the current culture of elitism  and nepotism in journalism can be changed.

Personally, I’ve been incredibly fortunate to come from what I would  consider to be a privileged background. Both my parents are doctors and I inherited money from my grandmother to buy my first flat in London when I was in my 20s. I was privately educated at a good school and went to  Cambridge, then got my masters from Columbia Journalism School.

Now I’m a reporter and producer for BBC World. A few months ago, I  went part time and took a £19,000 pay cut so I could spend more time  working – unpaid – on PressPad. Putting my own career on the back burner has enabled me to sign up 150 hosts and save 50 interns £25,000 in  accommodation costs, but it has also pushed me even further into debt. I no longer earn enough to pay all my bills, and it’s a struggle to meet  even the minimum payments on my credit cards.

I live in London, which isn’t cheap: I spend £1,315 a month on  mortgage costs, council tax and utility bills. Other monthly costs  include £120 on my commute, £20 on my mobile phone, £30 on contact  lenses and £200 on food. Before I signed the debt repayment plan, my  monthly minimum debt repayments came to £3,385 in total: 118% of my  current take-home pay. Plus I have to pay £3 a day for my overdraft.

Obviously, I wish I hadn’t got into so much debt, but I did it  because I care about the state of journalism in this country. I worry  that the media is run by a small group of people with a narrow set of  interests. We need to have people from different cultural and  socioeconomic backgrounds asking questions or we will fail to hold the  government and those in power in society accountable.

Windrush is a prime example of that. For a long time, no one in the  newsrooms knew that there were people who were having their citizenship  revoked, because they just didn’t know people from the Windrush  community.

I got my job at the BBC after doing three weeks’ unpaid work  experience there, staying with a family friend for free in London. Many  people from less privileged backgrounds are locked out of those  opportunities – and we need the media to be more representative.

PressPad offers a very practical solution to this problem and I am  feeling optimistic about its future after launching a crowdfunding  campaign for donations. The support I have received has been  heartwarming and the money that has been pledged would allow me to hire  an administrator and go back to work full time at the BBC. If I can do  that, I will be able to earn my way out of debt.
