I’ve just applied for my 143rd job in a  year. I’ve had 12 or 13 interviews but have not been successful so far.  My last employment was in December 2016, and I really enjoyed it, in  spite of the travelling. I was doing maternity cover in a laboratory at a company in Kendal, Cumbria, and responsible for testing raw materials  that go into food and the finished product. I would get up at 3.30am on a Monday and drive 183 miles, then stay in B&Bs (and later a bedsit)  for the week before returning to my home in Grantham, Lincolnshire by  early evening on Friday. I was almost hoping the woman I was covering  for would not return to work. But she did, and I’ve been without work  since.

I get £73 a week in jobseeker’s allowance to live on. I’ve been to my local Citizens Advice, but they say tough luck: if you are single  without children you are at the bottom of the pile. You had someone in a previous How I spend it column struggling to live on her £14,000-a-year income. I get a quarter of that. From that I’m supposed to pay for  food, groceries, gas, electricity, water, and so on. I’ve soon got to  find £200 for road tax and £200 for an MOT. I don’t know where it’s  going to come from.

My mortgage is £30,000, on an interest-only basis. It’s so far in  arrears that I’ve forgotten when I last paid it. I get some help with  the interest, but I’ve been told the house is probably going to be  repossessed. It’s worth about £150,000, so once Lloyds takes what’s owed to them I’ll have to find somewhere much cheaper.

I don’t have any savings. My former partner was giving me £500 a  month but we broke up in October. Fortunately, I get a little extra cash as a gift from my father every now and then. I don’t how long that can  last.

I nip into town by car on most days; it’s two miles and much cheaper  to use the car than take the bus. I regularly check the jobs advertised  in the local employment agency windows, after which I go straight to the reduced section in Morrisons. Then I wander round the other  supermarkets, in their cheap sections. After shopping I might go to a  cheaper cafe and have a coffee. It’s the only treat I give myself each  week. Cafes have lots of old papers in them, which I pick up for reading material when I get home. I used to buy the Guardian every day but I  can’t afford that now. I just buy it on a Saturday.

I worked for 17 years at Christian Salvesen near Grantham as a lab  manager. I started as a microbiologist on £17,000 a year and when I left I was on £24,000. People would be amazed at how little scientists are  paid in industry. It took another 20 years to get to a job paying  £35,000. The work I’ve done has included tests on samples, things like  frozen vegetables, making sure they were safe for consumers. I’m unusual that as a scientist I’m also very much into the arts; I like fine art,  classical music, the ballet; I met my former partner at a classical  music event. As a couple, it’s what we did a lot, going down to London,  to art galleries, that sort of thing. I obviously don’t have the money  for that now.

Because I’ve had bouts of unemployment I have never been able to save much for a pension. I think I have about £20,000 in total in my pension scheme.

But I’m fortunate that I have some very good friends locally. At the  moment, I also help out at Grantham museum on a history project which  will be part of Gravity Fields, a festival celebrating Isaac Newton. I’d love it if you could give them a mention, it’s a great event.

I still hope to find a job. I’m registered on many, many web sites  and over 200 agencies and about 30 to 50 jobs are emailed to me every  day. I used to be required to upload details of my job search to the  Department for Work and Pensions every day, but now you can’t because of [GDPR](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gdpr). I’m supposed to use the DWP website itself now, but it’s crap. The DWP  once sanctioned me for missing a meeting – I had got there a few minutes late. They withdrew my jobseeker’s allowance for a fortnight. I’m an  educated man with a lot of skills. I’m not a bitter or angry man. But  I’m livid at the way the government treats people like me. I don’t think I ever raised my voice at work at work, but if I met Iain Duncan Smith, I’d have a few choice words for him – and believe me, my vocabulary is  extensive.”
