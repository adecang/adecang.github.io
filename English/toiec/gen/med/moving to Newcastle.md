Lewis Roberts moved from London back to the north-east in search of a more affordable lifestyle.

**Name:** Lewis Roberts
**Age:** 34
**Income:** £34,000
**Occupation:** Social worker

Five years ago I decided to change careers and become a social  worker. I’d been working in healthcare regulation and I felt quite  disconnected from the job. Something about social work appealed to me.  I’d always been politically active and I wanted to tackle social justice issues.

At the time, my wife and I had been living in London for five years.  London wasn’t for us long term. We’d been thinking about getting on the  housing ladder and we could possibly have scraped a deposit together for a house but life in London just didn’t seem sustainable.

We didn’t want to get on the tube every day if we were going to start a family. Also, I planned to do a master’s and I knew money was going  to be tight. We decided to move to Newcastle, where I was born and later went to university.

We’ve been here for five years now and we love it. There’s a vibrant  arts and music scene and it’s close to amazing places like the  Northumberland coastline.

I earn about £34,000 – probably half of what I would be on if I  stayed in London and climbed the ladder. However, I have colleagues on  £28,000 who really struggle to make ends meet. In social work you can  work really long hours, often drive long distances, spend your own money supporting children and families, and cash flow can be really tight. My role involves helping complex young people move into specialist foster  homes. Once they have moved in, it’s my job to make sure they’re safe  and getting the support they need.

I’d say we’re fairly comfortable financially. We live in a  four-bedroom Victorian terraced house in Heaton. We have a 20-year  mortgage, which costs us £1,100 every month. Our council tax comes to  £150 a month and then other bills come to a few hundred. We spend about  £60 a week on groceries.

One of our big expenditures has been a 1980s camper van. We bought it for £3,500 then spent an additional £4,000 paying a specialist mechanic to sort it out. Its upkeep is quite expensive; road tax is about £25 a  month, insurance is about £400 a year, while the miles per gallon on it  are terrible. But we go on lots of day trips to the Northumberland  coast. My little boy, who is three, loves it.

Our other big expense is childcare. Although we do receive 30 hours  free a month, additional top-up nursery fees come to about £280 a month.

When it comes to holidays we usually spend £1,000 on accommodation  and flights and try to pull this from our salaries if we can and leave  our savings alone. 

My finances were tight throughout university and the transition to  working life was financially challenging. I got myself in debt and it  was only when I met my wife that I managed to get on top of it. My wife  is really good with money and moving to the north-east has helped me to  save and develop my financial management skills.

Now I’m quite good at making money go a long way. I put £200 into an  Isa every month. Through my work, I’ve started paying into a pension.  I’m still paying off my student loan, though; I have about £8,000 left.

Being a career changer is tough. My wife and friends are on a certain trajectory and starting again is difficult. It’s a humbling experience. I’m just starting to find my feet. But after four years of really  challenging work, I’m looking forward to the next chapter of my career.
