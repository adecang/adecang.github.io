This year has seen some big life-changers for me. I bought my first  house, a two-bedroom terrace in Pembroke, at the start of January, and  then a few weeks later I found out I was pregnant with my first child.  I’m due in two months, and now that I have a mortgage and soon a baby to care for, there’s going to have to be a real shift in my finances. I’m  going to have to be more creative with the money I do have.

I run a glamping business with three cabins in Pembrokeshire. I  didn’t set out to run a glamping site. When my dad semi-retired from  farming about 10 years ago, he sold the farmhouse where we had grown up, all of the agricultural buildings and all of the good farming land, and kept 10 acres of land which he had received grant funding from the  Woodland Trust to plant up as woodland and maintain.

I thought “wouldn’t it be cool to have a cabin in the woods” – to use as an art studio, and for family and friends to share. A local  carpenter built the little cabin, which we named Cwtch, meaning “snug”  in Welsh. Soon after, a cottage booking website approached us to see if  we would like to be featured on the site. This was back in 2010.

Now we have three cabins in the woods. We are open from April to  September, and it includes everything you need for a comfortable stay:  comfy beds with fresh cotton bedding, a campfire with a stocked log  store and hot showers, and then you have the Pembrokeshire Coast  National Park to explore. To be honest, though, bookings have fallen in  the past couple of years. There used to be really high demand, but the  market is more saturated now.

I earn £15,000 a year through the business, and with that I also pay a couple of local workers – a gardener and a cleaner – to help me.

I used to run an events business that turned over £150,000 a year,  but it was a huge amount of stress. When a job came up with the National Trust to work full-time as a property manager for a campsite and  holiday cottage, earning a salary of £25,000, I decided to quit the  events business. However, I probably still work a 60-hour week.

I used to follow a pattern of working my socks off for eight months,  then taking time out in the winter to go travelling. My most recent  winter trip was to Morocco, where I completed my yoga teacher training  qualification.

I don’t go mad with money. Before I was pregnant, I’d attend a lot of yoga classes and always go to the gym, but though I’ve still got  membership, which is about £20 for a local council one, I’ve slowed down on the classes.

I’m both fortunate and unfortunate in a way as I inherited money from my grandmother, which was enough to put down a deposit on my house.  However, it does feel a bit stressful at the moment because I bought it  on my own. My partner, who I met in October, already owned a house –  he’s carrying out a big renovation project, so we’re pretty skint.

My mortgage is £320 a month, and bills come to about £200. I might  spend about £100 a week on food, and I have a little van which costs  about £100 a month to run.

I try to save more during the summer but I’m not particularly  successful. Saying that, I do have a pension with the National Trust,  and I put in £200 a month, but that’s only been for the past two years.

I’ve definitely given up the foreign holidays and yoga classes – the  focus is getting food on the table and paying the bills. When I was  single I had no responsibility. There was no mortgage and I could just  jet off anywhere. I’ve been quite fortunate with money until now as I’ve earned a good income and I’ve been able to do anything I wanted to do.  Now I need to give a lot more thought to how I spend my money.
