It's called presenteeism and it's on the rise. 
A study by health insurer Vitality has found that more than 40% of employees said their work was being affected by health problems -  a figure that's risen by a third over the last five years. It found that people are putting aside both mental and physical health problems to attend work.
And in its recent annual Health and Well-Being at Work Survey Report the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) also found evidence of unhealthy trends[a][b][c] in the workplace. The CIPD said more than four-fifths (83%) of its respondents had observed presenteeism in their organisation, and a quarter (25%) said the problem had got worse since the previous year.
