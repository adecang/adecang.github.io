# The SNP will not be “dancing to Boris Johnson’s tune


The SNP will not be “dancing to Boris Johnson’s tune” on his demands to get a general election on 12 December, one of its MPs has said. Kirsty Blackman told Channel 4 News:

*We are keen for there to be a general election before the 12th. I don’t trust Boris Johnson. I’m not convinced I trust him to follow through on any promises that he’s likely to make on this.*
*We may have conversations with many different people but we will not be dancing to Boris Johnson’s tune on this.*
