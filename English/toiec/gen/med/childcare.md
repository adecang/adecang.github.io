My husband and I work in the hospitality  industry, running four traditional pubs and one restaurant in Edinburgh. We’ve been doing it for more than eight years and life is hectic –  especially as I’ve just returned to work after baby number two and  trying to grow a business in the fast-paced hospitality industry is  hard. But we always push ourselves to do better.

We lease the properties and run them as our own business. We were  proud that earlier this year our company, the Kilderkin Group, became  the first multi-operator in Edinburgh to pay its staff the national  living wage of £8.75 an hour. We’d been speaking about doing it for a  while and we wanted to get the business in a position in which we could  afford to do it. It was important for us because we want to see a change in the way hospitality is viewed – we want it to be seen as a viable  career option.

We both take a salary of about £50,000 a year out of the business and live comfortably off that. That kind of salary allows us to reduce our  working hours and spend time with our two young boys who are four and 19 months. I work one and a half days a week, although this will increase  soon to two, and my husband works about three days a week. We wanted to  be able to spend time with the children while they’re small. I want to  be involved in the day-to-day running of the business but still be  present for the boys. We both count ourselves as fortunate as I think  families feel the pressure to return to work. We have great managers who take the pressure off us and are very self-sufficient.

Saying that, childcare is one of our biggest expenses. Our eldest  attends a private nursery one day a week and the youngest has two days a week at nursery and together that costs about £700 a month. It’s a  massive expense. Also, two to three times a month we’ll pay for a  babysitter, who costs about £10 an hour. For example, we attended a  fundraising ball at the weekend and booked a babysitter for eight hours. In total, babysitting – including a taxi for the sitter – probably  costs in the region of £250 to £300 a month.

The children attend weekly activities such as rugby tots, musical  movement classes and swimming lessons, and that probably amounts to  about £75 a week. We’ll also eat out as a family, whether that’s lunch a couple of times a week or grabbing a bite to eat at the soft play, and  that will work out as an average of £25 each time.

We live in a detached bungalow close to Portobello beach in the east  side of the city. Our mortgage is £1,800 a month. Bills-wise it’s quite  an expensive house as we probably pay in the region of £250 a month on  gas and electricity – admittedly we do have the heating on a lot and  lights end up being left on all over the place. We also pay £60 a month  for a TV and broadband package. We also own a rental property in  Edinburgh and that brings in about £400 a month once the mortgage is  paid.

We spend a fortune on food – probably about £500 to £600 a month. I  usually shop at Sainsbury’s; I’m a sucker for a buy-one-get-one-free or  multi-buy deal.

We do have savings and Isas set up, although I’m not very good paying into them. My approach to money is about living in the moment and  spending it. I enjoy booking holidays and taking the boys to events.  Last month we enjoyed a 10-day all-inclusive break in Lanzarote which  cost about £2,500 in total. It was great for the kids and we’ve just  booked to go again next year. We’ve also just booked to go to Center  Parcs for the first time in March and that cost £400 for four days but  activities will be extra.

As we are a young family, I have my eye on the future and want to pay the mortgage off quicker if we can. I guess it’s about finding the  right balance.
