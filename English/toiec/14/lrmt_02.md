#### Conversation 1 : questions 11 to 13

M: Have you seen this email? They're launching a personal development program. It's about someting you'd like to do which can be job-related or not.  
W: So what types of things?  
M: Well, languages for one. But it could be sports, arts or banal things like IT. It's all on the internet. You put in the same username and password as for your computer and it tells you how many hours you have. Then you scroll through the menus and you find what you want to do.  
W: Interesting. I'll have to have a look this afternoon.

M: We've been down that road before but I guess we can try again.

#### Talk 1 : questions 17 to 19

So that brings us to the production figures for last year. As you know, we have four plants which have alla had varying success over the last twelve months. For each one you can see the quota and the actual figures. In our two oldest plants we were more or less on quota even if we fell slightly under by the end of the year. Detroit only opened in the middle of the year so despite appearing under quota, the figure on that chart shows an annual quota. So in fact we're very please with the way that it started. for our fourth plant you can really see the effect of both the breakdowns and the subsequent worker strike, which means we are a long way below  where we planned. I think it will be fair to say we are disappointed with the management of that situation.

17- What does the man explain about their oldest plants? **A: They are satisfied with the figures**

18- Look at the graphic. At which site are they disappointed with the management? **D: Greenville**  
19- What does he explain about Detroit? **B: It opened recently**

20- Who most likely is the woman? **A: A training manager**
