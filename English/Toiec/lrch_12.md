<strong>Talk 1</strong>
<br/>
I spend a lot of my time in meetings. We have weekly start meetings, decision-making meetings, brainstorming meetings and communication meetings. Sometimes it seems we spend so much time in meetings, we don't have time to work any more.

I'm the first person people see when they come into the building. So how I welcome people gives the first impression of the company to clients, suppliers, new members of staff. We have a lot of people coming through every day, so it can get pretty hectic.

I spend a lot of time out of the office. Business lunches, client meetings, (...)  my suppliers. I spend about half the day in my car and the other half pressing the flesh and presenting our product range.

My job is to help people with any problem they have with our service. Sometimes they need to be told how to use it, sometime they need to know about other services we offer, and sometimes they just phone up to complain and we have to come up with solutions for them.

I seem to spend a lot of my time on the phone. If a customer hasn't settled an invoice, if we need to free up money for a project, cutting a little bit off the budget, or making best use of our money, all of these fall under my remit

<br/>
I work in marketing and particularly product design. When we have a project that we think might be beneficial to the company, we have to present it to the executives. That's only about ten percent of the job but it's maybe the most important part. How well we convince them to sign off on it is crucial for new products to go on the market.

### Track 83 - Conversation 1 (Karen Price)

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_83.mp3)

HG: High Karen, I was going to call you back. I've just got out of a meeting.  
KP: I guessed it was probably someting like that. So, I hear a rumor that Valasko is thinking of changing supplier for next year?  
HG: Let's hope it's just a rumor, they're one of our biggest customers.  
KP: Exactly. So I've set up a meeting with them for next week. I told them it was just a chance to give them a bit of feedback and vice-versa. I was hoping you might be able to sit in, just to show them we are serious about them.  
HG: Absolutely no problem. Just let me know when and I'll make sure I'm free. I'll have a look at the contract and see if we can't give them an extra discount, just in case we get to negotiating prices.  
KP: Thanks Hanna, I think that will make a big difference.

*I've ***set up** a meeting: j'ai organisé une réuion  
I was hoping you might be able to **sit in**: j'espérais que peut-être tu pourrais participer*

### Track 84 - Conversation 2 (Jim Tyler)

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_84.mp3)

HG: Hanna Green.  
JT: Hello Hanna. Jim Tyler.  
HG: Hello Jim. How are things at Harvey's?  
JT: Well, that's just the thing. We were very happy when you were in charge of our account, but since you moved up we feel like things aren't quite the same.  
HG: I'm sorry to hear that. Gavin is one of our best sales people.  
JT: Don't get me wrong. He's obviously very good at sales. It's the after sales he's not so strong at. We feel like he's hard to get in touch with and there's no relationship there.  
HG: OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to make time in my schedule to be your major point of contact. Gavin will still be in charge of sales, but if at any point you need something or have a question, call me first. If you like we can discuss this in more detail over lunch. Are you available any time next week?  
JT: That's really not necessary. But I'm free Wednesday.  
HG: Then that's settled. I'll come to your offfice for twelve thirty and we can catch up over lunch.

*since you moved up: depuis que vous avez été promue  
We feel like...: nous avons l'impression  
that's settled: c'est arrangé  
we can catch up over lunch: profiter du déjeuner pour arranger ça, rattraper les choses*

### Track 85 - conversation 3 (Angharad Lloyd)

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_85.mp3)

HG: Angharad, it's Hanna. Do you have a minute?  
AL: Sure, what can I do for you?  
HG: I've heard from a friend of a friend that Soft Skills are going belly up. They've got a big contract with Red Square that it looks like they won't be able to honor.  
AL: Oh, well, we already have a contract with Red Square business travel agency.  
HG: Precisely. so this would be the credit cart business side of the company. Since we already know them they might want us to take over the rest of Soft Skills contracts.  
AL: Well, we've got great feedback from them so far. I know the training manager there pretty well. I'll arrange to go and see her and slip it into conversation.  
HG: Don't worry too much about the profit margin on this one. It's a big fish, so if we can finish off this contract for them there might be more to follow. Let me know how it goes, ok? and if you need anything.  
HG: Sure thing. Thanks for the tip.

*the belly : le ventre  
they are going belly up: ils sont en train de faire faillite (belly up, comme des poissons morts...)  
take over : reprendre  
great feedback so far : un excellent retour jusqu'à présent  
slip it into conversation: glisser ça dans la conversation

Thanks for the tip: merci pour le renseignement, pour le tuyau.*

If I had more money, I would change my car  
*Si j'avais plus d'argent, je changerais ma voiture (mais ça n'est pas le cas).*

If this client had signed the contract, I would have moved up  
*Si le client avait signé le contrat, j'aurai été promu (mais ça ne s'est pas fait).*

Saudi Arabia: l'Arabie Saoudite

### Track 87 - Radio interview with Grant Robertson

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_87.mp3)

I: We are joined today by Grant Robertson, international sales trainer and author of the book *desert sales*. Grant, you have huge experience of working in Saudi Arabia. How different is it to doing business in Europe or the United States?

GR: Well, first doing business around Europe already has differences depending on which countries you are operating in. The way we interact in meetings in the UK for example is very different to the way business is done in Germany. When a Briton tells you they think your idea is 'interesting', what they actually mean is that they are not interested in it at all. Germans on the other hand would take it literally and that can lead to all sorts of misunderstandings. On the other hand, those differences pale into insignificance when compared to Saudi Arabia. 

I: So, what's the first thing sales people should keep in mind if they want to work there?

GR: I would say the first rule of thumb is to dress for the part. Saudi will wear their 'thobes', the traditional long white robes, but you should be wearing a suit and a tie. All buildings are well air-conditioned so you don't need to worry too much about the heat. Don't feel that you need to imitate the way that they dress, but make sure that you're dressed smartly. They don't do business with people wearing jeans.

I: In your book, you talk about the importance of the greeting. Tell us about that.

GR: When shaking hands, make sure make it firm without trying to break anyone's fingers. If you are going to a meeting where a group of Saudis are already sitting, go around the room to your left, anticlockwise, shaking each person's hand. You should slightly bow your head and smile at the same time. It seems like a small detail but if you get that wrong, you 'll see in their body language that you've lost before you've even started.

I: But isn't it true that you are at a disadvantage if you are not a muslim? 

GR: No, that's a myth. You have to be respectful of prayer times and it is important to know when they are. Be careful about this because the times change every day. And if you are giving a presentation at one of those times, you need to be prepared to stop and put it on hold. Business does not and will not ever take precedence over prayer.

I: You talk about their traditional drink being an acquired taste.

GR: Absolutely. It's called 'gahwa'. It's hot water mixed with cardamon powder and you'll be served this at business meetings. If you drink it just to be polite, be warned they will fill up your cup again. Personally, I like it but it's not to eveyone's taste. It's one of the little things you need to prepare for. That goes hand in hand with small talk. Saudis want to know you and have a close relationship with you. If you can do that, you'll be ready to close.

I: Do you have one final piece of advice for anybody or sales people?

GR: Patience is a virtue. The Saudis are happy to do business but in their own time. If **all those fail**, talk about football. They're big, big fans of English football. When you leave, shake hands and thank them and  follow this up with a email to thank them again. They expect you to do this and genuinely appreciate it. It may take time but whan they make a promise in Saudi Arabia they usually keep it. Just don't expect **all the better** to happen at the first meeting
