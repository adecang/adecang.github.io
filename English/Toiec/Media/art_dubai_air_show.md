Sustainable, renewable, green: the buzz words of the environmentalists figured large at this week's Dubai Air Show. At the last show two years ago, such things barely[^1] registered.

This time we've had airline Etihad[^2] rename a Boeing 787 Dreamliner a "greenliner" and Airbus unveiling[^3] an experiment in which aircraft[^4] follow each other to reduce drag[^5] and save fuel[^6]. It mimics bird flight.
No press conference seems complete without a reference to aviation efficiency, and the president of Emirates airline even praised activist Greta Thunberg for helping focus minds on what they had to do.
Trouble is, not only does aviation contribute 2% of global emissions, that figure is set to rise over the next few years. No wonder critics reject aviation's pledge[^7] to become sustainable as hollow[^8].
So, have we seen greenwash[^9] in Dubai or a genuine commitment to change? What are airlines doing to help tackle the climate crisis? And can the industry really wean[^10] itself off fossil fuels?


The BBC's Talking Business programme went to the air show to speak to experts involved in aviation's attempt to clean up its act[^11].

[...] Commercial airlines are forecast to use about 97bn gallons of jet fuel this year, a record. But, says Alejandro Rios Galvan, a bioenergy expert and professor at Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, there is simply no alternative available in the short term. He believes plant based bio-fuels currently offer the best option. "These have the capacity to reduce the carbon footprint anywhere between 50-80% when you compare them to fossil." 
Bio-fuels are already being used in very small quantities. All flights from Los Angeles and Oslo, for example, carry a tiny bio-fuel mix. But there are many issues around price and production of this fuel. A problem is that airlines operate on wafer thin profit[^12] margins. They are not going to adopt anything that increases their cost base, he says. But he adds: "The costs [of bio fuels] have come down significantly as more infrastructure is built to refine these products. It may only be a few years before they can compete on par basis with cost of fossil fuel." [...]
