The session is chaired by Maireen McGuiness.

*Ursula Von Leyen (from Germany),EU Commission President)* — I want to use the words of the famous British poet George Eliot. She said : 'only in the agony of parting do we look into the depths of love.' We will always love you and we will  never be far. Long live Europe !

*Guy Verhofstadt (from Belgium, Alliance for Liberals and Democrats in Europe)* — So this vote is not an adieu. This vote, Mr President, is, in my opinion, only an au revoir. Thank you very much.

*Nigel Farage (from Britain, Brexit Party)* — What's not to like? I know you'ge going to miss us. I know you want to ban our national flags but we're going to wave you good bye and we'll kook forward in the future to working with you as sovereign… *[microphone cut off by Mairead Mc Guiness]*

*Mairead McGuiness (from Ireland, Vice President of the European Commission)* — if you disobey the rules you get cut off. Could we please remove the flags.

*Nigel Farage*  — That's it. It's all over. Finished!

*Mairead McGuiness* — Can I move now, and with a certain amount of guilty pleasure give the floor to Madam - and Professor Scott Cato. For one minute, please.

*Molly Scott Cato (from Wales, Britain, Green Party)* — With grief and regret, I accept that we will leave the European Union on Friday –Oh, no, here come the tears–. But we must keep the dream alive, especially for young people who are overwhelmingly pro-European. I hold in my heart that one day I will be baxh in this chamber celebrating our return to the heart of Europe. Thank you.

*Laura Huhtasaari (from Finland, Finn Party)* — Britain will triumph outside of the EU. The island nation began a shining movement that cannot be stopped. Farewell to the Brexit Party. I love you guys.

*Aileen McLeod (From Scotland, Scottish National Party)* — On Friday, Scotland will be dragged out of the EU against the democratic wisher of our people. And when the moment comes for Sotland to rejoin the EU,  I hope this parliament will welcome us in that same spirit onf European solidarity, and in the meantime, I hope very much that you will leave a light on for Scotland.

*Members singing:*  
For auld lang syne  
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,  
For auld lang syne.
