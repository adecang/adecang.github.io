### Track 2 - Kay Singh

[Track2](lrtk_02.mp3)

K: Open Bank, Kelly speaking. How may I help you?  
C: Hello, this is Kay Singh. I’m calling because I’ve been having some problems with my bank card.  
K: I’m sorry to hear that. What kind of problems?  
C: Well, every time I try to use it in a shop they have to swipe it three or four times before it works.  
K: I see. And is that the same for our ATMs?  
C: No, that seems to be OK for the moment.  
K: OK. Here is what I suggest. I’m going to order a new card straight away. It will take a few days before it arrives so in the meantime take the cash you think you’ll need from the ATM and I’ll give you a call as soon as the card is ready.

*To swipe : glisser, passer la carte  
I've been having some problems: present perfect continuous, retour sur une activité passée  
As soon as the card is ready : dans les subordonnées de temps on emploie le présent à la place du futur (= quand votre carte sera prête)*

### Track 3 - Cray Jones

C: This is Cray Jones from C.J. Butchers. I think we are going to have difficulties meeting our loan repayments this month.    
K: I see. Can you tell me what the problem is?  
C: One of our biggest customers hasn't paid his invoice for last month. He keeps promising to send a check but we haven't received it yet.  
K: Mmm. Don't worry. I can delay the payment so that you don't go overdrawn. Just give me a call when you get the check so that I can unblock the account. There might be a fee applied to your account but I can make sure you get that back at the end of the month. How does that sound?  
C:  Oh, that would be great. Thank you so much for your help.

*a loan : un prêt  
repayments : les traites  
an invoice : une facture  
to block, unblock an account : bloquer, débloquer un compte  
A fee : des frais*

### Track 4 - Tara Epstein

K: Oh, is that Tara Epstein?  
C: That’s right.  
K: Oh, Hello Ms Epstein. This is Kelly Holmes from Open Bank. I’m calling about the email you sent me this morning.  I understand you want to make an international bank transfer.  
C: Yes. I’ve sent money from one state to another before and that seems to work just fine. But I need to send some money to my son in Europe and the website keeps blocking me.  
K: Ok. There is a function on the website to do that but you will need to enter a different customer code.  
C: Oh, I saw that and I thought it was just my usual customer ID.  
K: No, for international transfers we’ll need to make you a new one. So I can take care of that and send it to you through the post but it will take a couple of days to arrive. Alternatively, if you have the account details, we can do it together on the phone.  
C: OK, that will be perfect.  
K: OK. So first I’ll need to ask you some identification questions just to check.

a state : ici : un des 50 états des US  
ID : identification  
your account details : votre numéro de compte

### Track 5

A. We’re conscious that we need to start to think about our retirement. What would you recommend?  

B. I’m thinking of making an MBA next year but I’m looking for a good way to invest my money in the meantime.  

C. Do you have any advice on how to invest on the stock market?  

D. We have found the perfect house to buy but we need to sell our place first and we haven’t even had a nibble yet.  

E. If we want to expand internationally, we’re going to need a big capital investment and I don’t see how we can raise that kind of money.  

F. I feel like my purchasing power is going down year on year. My salary has stayed the same but the prices in the supermarket have gone up by five per cent.  

G. If we want to be more competitive we really need to upgrade our computer systems but we just don’t have the money right now.

### Track 6 : Kristina Martins

Good afternoon everyone. For those who I haven’t yet had the pleasure to meet, my name is Kristina Martin and over the last few weeks I’ve been working with the finance department to see what we can do about maximizing the money we spend and help the company move forwards. I’ve put together a little chart to show you where the money is going at the moment.

The first thing that should jump out at you is your fixed costs. That’s to say this office building, the mortgage repayments, insurance, electricity, air conditioning and so on. For most companies this would amount for about 25 percent of expenses and right now we are at thirty percent. I have a couple of suggestions on how to reduce that. The tenth and eleventh floors have large conference rooms that are only ever used once or twice a month and rarely at the same time. We could look into renting out one or both of these floors to another company without any change in the offices on the other floors. In other words we wouldn’t be forcing people to work in open space offices.

Labour costs account for the second largest expense and this goes hand in hand with production. As you are aware you are the only company in the industry that still produces all of your products in the US. I know that you have chosen to keep the company one hundred percent American and I respect that. There are tax breaks available at the moment that are made for companies who help keep unemployment low. I’ve started to look into this and I think we have a real case to make that we comply with the regulations.

The first thing that surprised me when you contacted me was how little brand name recognition you have. The products are of a very high standard, which justifies the prices you choose but nobody can sell high quality products if the brand isn’t well known.

If we can cut five percent off our fixed costs and another seven or eight percent off labour costs and production my suggestion would be to give at least half of that over to marketing. You’d still be lowering expenses but with well-targeted campaigns you could make a significant difference to sales as well as profits, which is after all the bottom line.
