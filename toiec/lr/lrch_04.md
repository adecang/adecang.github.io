### Track 22 - conversation 1

W: I can’t believe we have so much stuff ! It’s just as well we are moving to a bigger house.  
M: I know. But I really think we could have taken the opportunity to get rid of some of our junk.  
W: Hey! If you get to keep your ugly armchair I can have my porcelain collection. That was the deal.

it’s just as well : ça tombe bien  
to get rid of : se débarrasser de  
ugly : laid 

### Track 23 - conversation 2

M: So we’ve built the outer wall which is this one here and we are going to start with the interiors next.  
W: So that’s the kitchen there. Is that going to be big enough for our three food cookers?  
M: Don’t worry. The rooms always look smaller on the plans.

big enough : assez grand  ≠ enough money : assez d'argent  
a cooker : une cuisinière. a steam cooker : un cuit-vapeur  

### Track 24 - conversation 3

W: This is the third house I was talking about. Do you want to take a look around inside?  
M: Sure ! It looks a bit bigger than the others. I hope it fits into our budget.  
W: Well the owners are anxious to sell quickly. Have a look around and we can talk finances after.

take a look around : faire le tour, visiter, jeter un coup d’oeil  
it fits into our budget : elle rentre dans notre budget  
anxious : ici, pressés 

### Track 25 - conversation 4

W: Is that going to be ready for the client meeting this afternoon?  
M: It’ll be touch and go. I didn’t have time to work on it yesterday so I’ve had to rush it this morning.  
W: So long as the glue dries on time we should be OK.

touch and go : très serré, pas gagné d'avance  
I’ve had to rush it : j'ai dû faire vite

### Track 26 - Lisa

I’ve been working for a few years now and I have enough money for a down payment. I’ve spoken to the bank. Apparently a five hundred thousand dollar mortgage is going to come out at more or less the same cost as the rent on my current apartment. The rates are really low so I have to get in now before they start to go up. I think I’m going to go for it.

*I’ve been working for a few years now : ça fait maintenant quelques années que je travaille  
current : actuel (ici)  
I'm going to go for it : je vais me lancer*  

### Track 27 - Greg

Greg: I’m seriously considering getting a condo. I’m not really interested in working in the yard, spending my weekends checking the gutters or painting the walls plus it’s a good first step on the housing market. And I’ve been throwing money out of the window for the last few years on rent.

*the yard : le jardin  
gutters : les gouttières  
to throw, threw, thrown : lancer, jeter*

### Track 28 - Kamara

I think it’s too early for me to lay down roots. I don’t know what I’m going to be doing in two years’ time. If I buy now, I’m going to barely get my money back if I have to sell a couple of years down the road. If I can find a cheap place to rent, that gives me more possibilities if I want to move on. If I’m offered a job across the country, I can leave at the drop of a hat.

*to lay down roots : m'enraciner  
barely : à peine, tout juste  
a couple of years down the road : d'ici quelques années  
move on : évoluer  
if I’m offered : si on m'offre (passif, be +Vpp)  
across the country, : à l'autre bout du pays  
leave, left, left : quitter, partir  
at the drop of a hat : comme bon me semble, à tout moment*

*a condo (condominium ) ≠ an apartment  
a detached, semi-detached, terraced house  
an owner, a tenant: un propriétaire, un locataire  
common areas: les parties communes*

### Track 29

A  
M: We really need to move !  
W: You’re telling me ! Those kids upstairs spend all day running around and shouting.  
B  
W: I think I may have to put on another layer of clothing.  
M:  I could turn the radiators up. But it’s already costing us an arm and a leg.  
C  
M: We should look into buying. The rent keeps going up every month.  
W: Then you’d start worrying about the mortgage. I know two people who’ve had their houses repossessed.  
D  
W: I’m not going another day without hot water.  
M: I’ll call Mr Stokes again. But I think he’s been screening his calls.  
E  
M: I’m glad I’m not a tenant any more. Have you thought about buying?  
W: I’ve thought about it but I don’t want to leave the city and that’s out of my price range.  
F  
W: Bob, it’s raining. There’s water coming through the roof !  
M: I thought we’d fixed that. I’m going to have to pay for someone to come by and look at it again.  
G  
M: This place is big enough for the two of us.  
W: I suppose so. But if there were three of us, we might find it a bit poky.

### Vocab builder

a layer : une couche  
people who have had their houses repossessed [z] : … se sont fait saisir leur maison  
to screen : filtrer

### Track 30

Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for being here. I’m going to give you an overview of the project: what types of properties we’re offering, as well as the services and amenities. After that I’ll pass you over to Alan who can take you through the finer points of the financing of the project.

So, here you can see the plans for the new property development. Work is scheduled to begin at the beginning of next month and delivery all being well should be in two years’ time. As you can see it’s a low-rise project, just four storeys and each floor has three flats.

The ground floor flats each have a private rear garden. The first and second floor flats have large balconies on two sides and the top floor flats each have access to private roof terraces.

The flats have been designed with two basic layouts. They all have three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a living-room but some of them come with a fully fitted kitchen while others have just a small kitchen area with a sink, a fridge, a microwave and a worktop. Our research has shown that about  fifty percent of londoners don’t have time to cook and prefer somewhere where they can prepare a salad, eat up a dish and wash a plate or a glass. The rest of the time they eat out or they get a take-out.  And so they prefer to maximize their living space instead of giving over[^] space to a kitchen they have no use for. 

On the other hand we know that families particularly those with young children require a kitchen and so we are aiming to offer a property with something for everyone. In term of services each flat comes with a parking space in our underground garage. We have security cameras and personnel regularly doing rounds to ensure the safety of our residence.  

Adjacent to the parking garage will be a gym with exercise equipment exclusively for residents with trained fitness instructors available in the morning, early afternoon and at weekends.

In terms of location we are close enough to the town centre for it to be walkable but far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle of a city centre. For those with children it’s about a five-minute drive to the local primary schools and there are buses that will take you to the secondary schools in about twenty minutes.

So that’s the two different types of properties, of services and amenities. I’ll pass you over now to Alan to talk to you about finance.
