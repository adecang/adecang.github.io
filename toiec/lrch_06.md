## Page 59 - Logistics

###  Track 40 - Interview of Johnny Harris 

IN: How do you manage a global logistics strategy?

JH: The first thing to keep in mind is that you can’t have the same strategy in each geographic region. For example, in the last ten years there has been some real growth in logistics in Western Europe. But that pales into insignificance when you compare it to Eastern Europe. A good example is the automotive industry where most major car manufacturers have opened a plant in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland. They have the advantage of having lower labor costs. But crucially they are closer to the target market. We have been involved from the beginning in setting up the plants to integrate our logistics strategy.  

IN: You have talked a lot in the past about a door-to-door service. What do you mean by that exactly?  

JH: A good example is a service we run for a company in Spain. They have two plants : one in Malaga, the other in Granada. We take the raw materials at the two plants in Spain and transport them overseas to Freetown in Sierra Leone. They then have to be taken more than five thousand kilometers to Brazil where the finishing touches to the products are added. We then take the products back along the same route to Spain. That means that the same containers are in transit all the time. We take care of all the customs formalities at each port. So we guarantee every step of the operation, which for our client means reduced transit times and little to no lost product.   

IN: How easy is it to guarantee deadlines?

JH: It’s not easy at all. We set targets per region and per product and we try to stick to them as much as possible. One solution that we have pioneered in the UK is our eighteen eight rule. That means for all urgent deliveries if your order is placed before six pm, or eighteen hundred hours, we guarantee you will receive it by eight o’clock the next day. Of course for that to work companies must be on site to receive the products or the components before eight am. 

*The automotive industry: le secteur automobile  
A car manufacturer : un constructeur automobile  
we have been involved from the beginning : nous sommes impliqués depuis le début  
to run a service : faire fonctionner, offrir un service...  
raw materials: la matière première. Un peu étrange dans ce contexte.  
customs formalities : les formalités douanières  
every step : chaque étape  
to set a target : fixet un objectif (a target = une cible)  
components : les composants*

### Grammar: present perfect

Present perfect : have opened (pas de date), have been involved since (depuis), have talked in the past, one solution we have pioneered (action accomplie, pas de date)

### Track 41 - Ron and Jill Wardley produce olive oil

RW: We started making oil about ten years ago, didn't we Jill?  
JW: Yes. It was the year after we bought the olive grove. So we had about ten olive trees before that and that gave us another fifty or so.  
RW: The production method is quite simple. At first we lay down nets to catch the olives that fall.  
JW: We use an electric shaker to pick them now, but when we started we did it all by hand which took a lot longer.  
RW: I don't miss doing that. After that we gather up the nets and empty them into big plastic crates.  Depending on the year we might have anything between twenty and forty crates stocked in our garage.  
JW: Thirty seven this year I think, about nine hundred kilos in all. It took us five trips to take them all off to the mill.  
RW: So next we tip all of the olives into a hopper and a little mechanical bridge carries them up to be washed.  
JW: Then once they're clean we drop them into a tray. After that they are funneled into bins, which malaxes them  and turns them for an hour.   
RW: The malaxer effectively turns them into a brown paste, which makes you wonder whether this is what you wanted or not.  
JW: But the mill moves them along into a massive centrifuge.  
RW: And then it produces perfect organic extra virgin olive oil.  
JW: We had about a hundred and fifty liters this year. Some we keep. We give some to the family and we sell the rest. It's a lot of work but it's worth it.

*a grove : un bosquet, un verger  
an olive grove : une oliveraie  
another fifty or so : environ cinquante de plus  
a net : un filet  
to shake: secouer  
to pick fruit : ramasser/cueillir  
a crate : une caisse  
a mill : un moulin  
a hopper : une trémie (pour trier)  
a tray : un plateau  
to funnel : conduire, canaliser  
a funnel : un entonnoir  
a paste : une pâte  
a centrifuge : une centrifugeuse*
