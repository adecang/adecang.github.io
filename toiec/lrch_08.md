### Track 52 - Picture Questions

Talk 1

<details><summary>I like to be my own boss. I used to work for a big company where there  was litthe room for innovation. Now I make my own rules. I started out small but I built myself up and a really strong relationship with suppliers and a loyal group of customers. I worked at a strategy in the beginning and it's all coming to fruition now.

Talk 2

<details><summary>I'm the one behind the scenes who is responsible for the new products of the company. The strategy is laid out by people upstairs and I have to make it come to life. Sometimes they have ideas which seem impossible but with a little research and some innovative thinking we can usually produce something that keeps us one step ahead of the competition.</summary>

Talk 3

<details><summary>I have quite a successful business. I actually started from my bedroom when I was thirteen. I've always been adept with computers and the website I started was just supposed to be for fun. These days I get about five hundred thousand hits a day. I didn't really have a strategy at the beginning but when it started to be popular I knew I could do someting to keep it up to date, user-friendly and, well, monetize it at the same time.</summary>

Talk 4

<details><summary>We started out as college students who wanted to think outside the box and make our own way in the world. It's exciting to think that what started out as a conversation in a bar has now turned into an up and coming business. We always knew what we wanted to do but it wasn't until an angel investor came along that we were able to put our ideas into action.</summary>

Talk 5

<details><summary>When a company has a turmover of 24 billion dollars a year, there is still a lot of pressure to grow the business, expand into new markets and define strategy on a global level. What we decide in the boardroom can be the difference between doubling our market share or losing customers to our competitor who has a new product or service that fits the market better than we do.</summary>

## Page 82 - Present Perfect 2

### Grammar Corner 1

Cette leçon présente des cas où on doit employer le present perfect et non le prétérit.

"unfinished periode of time" = une période qui va jusqu'au moment présent.  
"unfinished actions" :  dans ce cas le français emploie le présent.  
"unfinished negative actions" : traduction an passé ou au présent

### Find the mistake

1  
The company *has had* offices in the UK ten years ago : impossible, avec ago on doit utiliser le prétérit. Deux possibilités :  

1. The company had offices in the UK ten years ago : il y a dix ans, la société avait des bureaux au Royaume-Uni.
2. **The company has had offices in the UK for ten years** : cela fait dix ans que la société a des bureaux au Royaume-Uni, la société a des bureaux au Royaume-Uni depuis 10 ans.

2  
We *haven't had* a serious company strategy when I joined the firm. Même impossibilité avec when qu'avec ago, les deux renvoient l'action dans le passé.:

1. **We didn't have a serious company strategy when I joined the firm**: nous n'avions pas… mais cela a pu changer.
2. **We haven't had a serious company strategy since I joined the firm** : dempuis que j'ai rejoint l'entreprise, nous n'avons jamais eu...

3  
The R&D departement has wanted extra investment for years now : OK, cela fait maintenant des années que le service recherche et développement veut...

4  
Even our most committed (dévoués, investis) employees *hasn't* always followed the company strategy: temps correct ("always" = unfinished period of time) mais employees est un pluriel:  
**Even our most committed employees haven't always followed…**

5  
Our share price wen down three times this week. Correct en anglais américain. En anglais britannique, on doit employer le present perfect avec this week (unfinished period of time):   
**our share price has gone down three times this week.**

6 The CEO *has sent a message* last night : avec last night (finished period of time), on emploie le prétérit:  
**The CEO sent a message last night**

### CH8 page 83 - Company Strategy

### Track 53 - Giving advice on company strategy

A 2  
M: I've been talking to the bank about raising money through selling bonds. That way we could really think about attacking the Asian market.  
W: That's all right if it works. What happens if it doesn't work out? We'd be taking a big risk.

B 8  
W1: We have a really good product but we haven't managed to penetrate in the way we thought we would.  
W2: I've been saying for ages that the only thing this company is lacking is a strong advertising campaign. We're just not as well known as our competitors.

C 1  
M: We're going to have to drastically reduce our expenses. The board keep asking about our stock price *(le prix de nos actions)*.  
W: Tell them we need to have a long-term strategy. Short term gains will seriously impact on employee commitment.

D 4  
W: If we merge with Data Systems we'll get their server knowhow which would really make a difference to our cloud software solutions.  
M: That's not a bad idea. It would be mutually beneficial.

E 3  
W1: Have you heard about the rebranding the board is suggesting?  
M: You mean the name change? It would distance us from the bad publicity we got last year but it would take some getting used to *(publicity ≠ advertising)*.

F 7  
M: With the the exchange rate the way it is, we're hardly making any profits from our overseas operations.  
W: And we're losing market share at home. I think we need to pull out from Europe and focus on our core market.

G 5  
W: We're doing Due Diligence on Free Time. If it looks workable and we can keep their customer base  it will realy increase our market share.  
M: Be careful. If this leads to a massive redundancy plan, people won't be happy and it will be tricky and expensive.

H 6  
M: Our market study shows that customers are mostly unhappy with our hotline operators. They say they are rude and condescending.   
W: I know. We really should put some training across the board on handling client complaints and delivering friendly helpful customer service.

### Filling the gaps in a text

When Bright Sparks was founded **in** 1987 *(cas 1, months, years)*, their strategy was very simple. They wanted to become a national player **by** the end of the century *(cas 2, deadline, date limite, échéance)*. In fact, they reached that goal *(but)* **in** 1988, with over than 30% of market share in the UK. **At** that time in their development *(cas 1)* they hadn't thought further ahead *(pas poussé la réflexion)*. An executive meeting was called **in** Spetember of that year to set new goals and objectives. Those goals changed  **over** the next decade *(cas 3: extended periode of time)* as the company went from strength to strength *(strength: la force, un point fort)* to become the worldwide leader **by** the  end of the century *(cas 2: deadline)*.

### Track 54 - Farrah Read

FR: Jacqueline, this is Farrah Read from Totally Travel. Do you have a minute?  
JS: Of course. Did I hear you say Totally Travel? So you did agree to change the name of the company.   
FR: It was one of the conditions of the merger but it's growing on me *(je m'y fais bien)*.  
JS: So what's new?  
FR: Well, my role for a start. It's not so easy to run a company when you have two CEOs. It feels like one of us is going to get the bullet any minute now.  
JS: Oh, I won't lie to you. It's really a long-term solution but there are some companies who have managed it successfully. You need to set out clear guidelines on the direction you're planning to take the company in.

*So you **did** agree : donc tu a **bien** donné ton accord…  
it's growing on me : je m'habitue, je commence à apprécier  
a bullet: une balle  
to take the bullet: perdre son poste*  

### Track 55 - Matthiew Rice

JS: Mathiew, this is Jacqueline Smith returning your call. How are things at Global Farmers?  
MR: Oh, hi Jacqueline. Thanks for getting back to me. To be honest, the answer to your question is not great. Patents are running out. The FDA are taking for ever on clinical trials. We are looking at having to make cuts again this quarter. It'st not doing wonders for company morale.  
JS: I see. So do you have products in the pipeline?  
MR: Several. But it might be months before we can go to market.  
JS: OK. So you're right about company morale. So you want to be careful about how you move forward. If you start imposing cuts you're going to be in for trouble and it will do nothing for your value on Wall Street.  
MR: So what do you suggest?  
JS: Speak to the board and tell them they might have to take a short-term loss to make a long-term gain. Once those products become available in six months, you'll be fine. Work out your most likely forecast for the next twelve months and give the something to think about. At the same time, brief your heads of departments  on the same thing. If you can stick together, you'll get through it. Let's get together this week to work on your presentation. That will give us a clear idea of what we are dealing with.  
MR: And you think that will work?  
JS: It's not a sure thing but I think it's your best plan of action.

*Patents: les brevets  
the FDA : the US Food and Drug Administration, en charge des autorisations de mise sr le marché des médicaments.  
clinical trials: essais cliniques  
in the pipeline: en préparation  
morale :le moral  
morals: la morale  
you'll get through it: vous y arriverez*  

### Track 56 - Sarah Fields

SF: Jacqueline, this is Sarah Fields from Real Properties. Did you get my email?  
JS: I was just about to reply. I understand you're thinking about making an offer to buy York Estates.  
SF: Exactly. I want to put the idea to the board next week. I was wondering if you had any thoughts.  
JS: I've done a little bit of digging. They seem to have a solid financial basis.  Their coverage is quite small but they do fill in some of the gaps in your network.  
SF: So, you think we should go for it.  
JS: Well, essentially you're looking at a horizontal merger. That's to say you both work in the same market. There's nothing wrong with that but I wonder if that's the best move for you right now. If you want to really grow the business, you might want to look at something more vertical.  
SF: I'm getting you have somehing in mind.  
JS: Well, a little birdie told me that McGrath are looking for an investor.  
SF: McGrath? Don't they deal with office building?  
JS: They do, and they're good at it.  The brand is strong, they have a good network and they might be open to a merger. That gives you a hold on both sides of the real estate market. Have a think about it. If you want, I can get one of my guys to start doing diligence on them.  
SF: Ok, do that. But can you do the same on York, in case it doesn't work out?  
JS: No problem. Let's stay in touch.

*to dig : creuser  
do a little digging : faire quelques recherches  
a little birdie (bird) told me: mon petit doigt m'a dit  
to hold: tenir  
that gives you a hold : cela vous donne la maîtrise*

## Page 87 - Concierge Service

### Track 57 - Kate and James

J: Hi Kate! Is it true that you're the one who thought up the new concierge service?  
K: Oh, Hi James! Yes, it's an idea I got from a company I used to work for.  
J: So, How does it work exactly?  
K: Well, they offer all sorts of services. They can do your dry cleaning, organise your business or your personal travel, make reservations in restaurants, anything you need really.  
J: And that's all free?  
K: For the employees, yes. For the company it's an expense but it's considered to be cost-effective in the long run.  
J: It's certainly true that with my work hours I don't have a lot of time to take care of my personal life.   
K: That's the whole point. You can forget the stress of trying to cram everything in and concentrate on your work. That's good for us and good for you. It's all about employee satisfaction.  
J: I thought that employee satisfaction came from the job itself.  
K: It does, but there are lots of companies where you could do the same job but not every company offers the extra things we do, it makes us stand out.  
J: but if you use the money from the concierge service to increase our salaries, wouldn't that have the same effect?  
K: Not according to the research. People often complain about salary but that's just human nature. We always want more. If companies want to retain their talent, money alone is never enough.  
J: I suppose the question is, how do you measure it? How do you know if people have more job satisfaction or not?  
K: We do audits. We try to gauge how people feel about their jobs before and after new innovations but the reality is in what we see. If people choose to stay and invest in the company we see that in their attitude to work. If people start looking for other jobs we think about what we can do differently.  
J: That makes sense, I plan to take advantage of it in any case. 

*to think up someone : concevoir  
cost-effective: rentable  
in the long run : in the long term  
to cram things in : faire tenir les chose, remplir, bourrer  
it makes us stand out :  cela nous fait sortir du lot  
outstanding: remarquable  
to gauge: jauger, mesurer  
to take advantage of: tirer parti de, profiter de, exploiter*
