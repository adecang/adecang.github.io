Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We’re just about ready to depart. We’re experiencing some delays today due to a signal failure between Nuneaton and Loughborough.

So city buses to the town centre now leave from the side exit on Midland road.

### Questions 20 through 22

Welcome everyone. My name is Sandra Harris. And thank you for coming to our ‘Invest in the Best’ seminar. Now for any of you looking to find out how to get involved in an IPO or flip shares, I’m sorry to tell you that you’re in the wrong class. But that is something we will be covering in a couple of weeks’ time. So, keep checking the schedule. Today we’re less interested in ‘Get Rich Quick Plans’ than retirement funds or how to prepare for your years after you stop working. I see a lot of young faces out there and that’s good because how long you invest for is crucial to how well you’ll do when you retire. We’ll be looking at what exactly is the difference between defined benefit, final salary and defined contribution schemes. Whether you should be investing in equity, cash or bonds and what fees to look out for.

20: Who most likely is Sandra Harris?  
21: When she speaks about “Get Rich Quick Plans”, she means :
