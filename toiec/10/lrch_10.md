Look at the four pictures. Where are the people and what are they doing?

**Talk A** 

<details>
<summary>
I usually take about a twenty-minute lunch break. Sometimes I have a sandwich at my desk but if the weather is nice I take the sandwich outside and stretch my legs at the same time.

**Talk B**

<details>
<summary>
B: I'm lucky because where I work we have a cafeteria. There's quite a good choice of dishes ranging from salads to hot meals and it's subsidized by the company so it's really  unexpensive.

**Talk C**

<details>
<summary>
I meet clients for lunch on average three or four times a week. It's a good way to get to know someone and a lot of deals are sketched out over desserts.

**Talk D**

<details>
<summary>
I don't have a lot of time for cooking when I finish work. I generally stop to get take out at a deli or one of the Asian restaurants in town.  It's really not expensive and it saves me having to cook or wash up.

</details>

**Talk E**

<details>
<summary>More often than not I skip lunch altogether. If I do take a break in the middle of the day I get fast food. A burger or a hotdog might not be the most nutritious but it fills a hole and tides me over till the end of the day. </summary>

**Talk F**

<details>
<summary>We organise a lot of breakfast meetings. None of us are what you would call morning people so if you have pastries and bagels during the meeting you can sleep a little longer because you don't need to take time to eat before leaving home.</summary>

### Track 64 - Suki
[Audio](lrtk_64.mp3)

I've taken a lot of business associates to lunch there. The tables are not too close together so you have a little bit of intimacy. It can get crowded at lunchtime so I always make a reservation. but it's never too noisy. The food is good but I always avoid the pasta, I'm scared I'll end up with sauce all over my blouse. The best thing about it though is the service. They don't leave you waiting too long between courses and they always have a smile. That makes my clients feel at ease, which is good for my business too.

*the crowd: la foule  
crowded : encombré, saturé, il y a trop de monde  
to make a reservation : réserver  
to avoid: éviter  
a blouse: un chemisier*

### Track 65 - Peter

[Audio](lrtk_65.mp3)

I've been there a few times with my wife for dinner. I understand why they don't take reservations on Fridays or Saturdays because it can get pretty crowded. If you arrive early enough, you can usually get a table quite quickly but after eight o'clock they have a queue out the door. What we like especially is that it's real Italian food. The waiter is Italian and it's just what we had in Florence last summer. It's quite simple food and there's definitely no Hawaiian pizzas on the menu but it's delicious.

### Track 66 - Gabrielle

[Audio](lrtk_66.mp3)

We go there for lunch sometimes  during the week. I always get the same thing. The spicy penne pasta is to die for. The others tell me that everything is good but that was the first dish I had there and it was so good I can't bring myself to have anything else. The only downside is it isn't on the special lunchtime menu. That seems to be what most people get because even the cheapest pizza and the cheapest dessert comes to eighteen dollars and then you get a drink on top. Mind you, even for a few bucks more the penne is worth... every penny.

*I can't bring myself to : je ne peux pas me résoudre à  
the only downside: le seul inconvénient, le seul bémol  
That seems: 'that' reprend 'the special lunchtime menu'  
on top: ici, en plus, par dessus le marché  
a few bucks: quelques dollars (fam.)  
a penny: un centime, un sou

### Track 67 - Grace

N: Sunset café, Naomi speaking. Can I help you?  
G: Hello. I'd like to make a reservation for a party of eight please.  
N: OK. For what night?  
G: For Friday at eight o'clock.  
N: That's fine. And your name please?
G: Grace Park, and I have a request. It's my sister's birthday on Friday. I'm planning to make her a cake and I was wondering if you could serve that for us for dessert?  
N: Sure, we can do that. If you want it to be a surprise, bring it to us earlier in the day and we can bring it out with sparklers whenever you're ready.  
G: Oh that's great. I'll bring it over around six o'clock.

### Track 68 - Patrick

P: Hello, I'd like to make a reservation for Tuesday lunchtime please.  
N: Certainly. At what time?  
P: Midday. And it's for a rather important business meeting. Do you have a table that is a little more secluded?  
N: Let me check. There's a table in the upstairs dining-room which is next to one of the bay windows. You have a view of the beach and we generally fill up downstairs first so it should be reasonably quiet. That's a two-top. Is that going to be OK?   
P: Yes. There's just the two of us and thanks, that sounds perfect.  
N: I just need to take your name then please.  
P: Patrick Eriksson.  
N: Is that with a c or a k?  
P: With a k and a double s.  
N: Ok, that's fine. Thank you Mr Eriksson, we'll see you on Tuesday at noon.

N: Oh, hello Miss James. What can I do to help?  
B: I know it's very short notice but you would not be able to give me a table for four this lunchtime, would you?  
N: Oh, I'm not sure. Let me have a look. We don't have much available but I do have a table reserved for one o'clock. If you think you could be done by then, you could have that.  
B: Ok, I can work with that. Do you know which waiter will be serving us?  
N: That should be Joseph.  
B: Good, he's excellent. Tell him I'll give him a good tip. We'll be there at eleven forty-five and thanks again.  
N: That's no problem. see you in a couple of hours.

*It's short notice: je m'y prends au dernier moment

### Track 70 - Tania

[Audio](lrtk_70.mp3)

My personal rule is to never say to someone, "let's do lunch".  It's not that it's too informal because it's accepted today that we are more and more informal in business situations. The issue is that there must always be a reason for a business lunch. It could be to make acquaintances with a new colleague or client. It could be to celebrate a deal. Having a clear reason for why you want to invite someone to lunch is the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful lunch.  
After that, choosing a restaurant is the next important thing. Don't choose somewhere close to your office and far from your clients' work. If you want them to do business with you, you have to go the extra yard.  
Next, find if they have any food preferences. Is your client a vegetarian? Are they comfortable with spicy food? If you make assumptions about what your client will or won't eat, you will fall at the first hurdle.  
Of course you should always make a reservation. Ther's nothing worse than turning up somewhere and having to wait for a table. Make sure you arrive early if you are inviting and do your best to be on time if you are invited.  
Usually at a business lunch we avoid appetizers. It's rare that people want a three-course meal. On the rare occasion that a client wants an appetizer, I do the same but generally it's just a main course and coffee.  
Like appetizers, it's uncommon today that someone wants to order alcohol. In case a client wants a glass of wine, I always decline and sticks to soft drinks. Some people think they should do the same as their client. Nobody has ever made a scene because I chose something different.  
And of course, before the food arrives, you should make small talk. People don't want and don't expect to speak business immediately.  
As for food, choose something light and simple. If you order an enormous plate of sea food while your client has a salad, you will still be eating once your client has finished. Let's just say that's not the done thing.  
When it comes to the end of the meal, we often imagine that the person who does the inviting should pay. If I have been invited I always make an offer to pay. If I'm inviting I often arrange with the restaurant to pay before we eat. It's a smooth way to avoid the problem.  
One final thing. Lunch is the opportunity to meet people, talk and hopefully do a business deal soon after. It's not the time or place to make a full presentation of your products or services. Too much hard selling over lunch is rarely successful.

*let's do lunch: on va casser la croute?  
make acquaintances: faire connaissance  
go the extra yard: faire un effort, faire le maximum  
a hurdle: une haie (course à peid), un obstacle  
fall at the first hurdle: achopper sur le premeir obstacle  
appetizers: hors-d'oeuvre, amuse-gueule  
the main course: le plat principal  
a three-course meal : 'three-course' est en position d'adjectif donc invariable  
make small talk: parler de choses et d'autres  
sea food: des fruits de mer  
that's not the done thing: ça ne se fait pas, ce n'est pas la chose à faire  
a smooth way to: la manière douce de..  
hard selling: pratique de vente agressive
