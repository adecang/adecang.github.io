Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. We’re just about ready to depart. We’re experiencing some delays today due to a signal failure between Nuneaton and Loughborough. So we are now scheduled to arrive in Sheffield at around 8:30. This service does not have a buffet bar but we will be passing through the carriages serving soft drinks and snacks.

#### Questions 20 through 22

Welcome everyone. My name is Sandra Harris. And thank you for coming to our ‘Invest in the Best’ seminar. Now for any of you looking to find out how to get involved in an IPO or flip shares, I’m sorry to tell you that you’re in the wrong class. But that is something we will be covering in a couple of weeks’ time. So, keep checking the schedule. Today we’re less interested in ‘Get Rich Quick Plans’ than retirement funds or how to prepare for your years after you stop working. I see a lot of young faces out there and that’s good because how long you invest for is crucial to how well you’ll do when you retire. We’ll be looking at what exactly is the difference between defined benefit, final salary and defined contribution schemes. Whether you should be investing in equity, cash or bonds and what fees to look out for.

20: Who most likely is Sandra Harris?  
21: When she speaks about “Get Rich Quick Plans”, she means :  
22: Who most likely is the audience?

IPO (Initial Public Offering) : introduction en bourse  
flip shares : "flipping", revente des actions immédiatement après l'achat  
a class: un cours - to cover a subject : traiter un sujet  
retirement funds : fonds de pension. to retire : prendre sa retraite  
defined benefit scheme : régime de retraite à prestations définies  
final salary scheme : régime fondé sur le salaire de fin de carrière  
defined contribution scheme : régime de retraite à contribution définie  
equity : actions (en bourse). bonds : obligations  
look out : prêter attention, faire attention

#### Talk 1 : questions 17 to 19

*So that brings us to the production figures for last year. As you know, we have four plants which have alla had varying success over the last twelve months. For each one you can see the quota and the actual figures. In our two oldest plants we were more or less on quota even if we fell slightly under by the end of the year. Detroit only opened in the middle of the year so despite appearing under quota, the figure on that chart shows an annual quota. So in fact we're very please with the way that it started. for our fourth plant you can really see the effect of both the breakdowns and the subsequent worker strike, which means we are a long way below  where we planned. I think it will be fair to say we are disappointed with the management of that situation.*

You'll find a full schedule of today's speakers on the agenda I've left you at the back of the room. So take a copy and hopefully by the end of today you'll be ready to meet your objectives for this quarter and bring new clients to our portfolio. So I'll leave you now and in just a few minutes Clive Gosling and his Effective Presentations will be here.* 

20- Who most likely is the woman? **A: A training manager**
