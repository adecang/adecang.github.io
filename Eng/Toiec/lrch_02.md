### Track 8 - reactions to new policy

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_08.mp3)

Listen to the opinions of the employees and fill in the chart (= tableau). Say what heir position (= poste) is in the company, whether they agree or disagree with the new policy and why they feel that way.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Claire Bourne</strong> 
	<br/>I'm the director of the human resources departement that came up with the new rules for annual leave. It's often a problem making sure that we have enough staff in the office at all times of the year, whether they be quiet or busy periods. This system means that no-one will be able to stockpile vacation time and take a whole month off at the end of the year.
</summary>
<strong></strong>
<i>
	<br/>the department that came up with : le service qui a conçu...
	<br/>whether they BE : subjonctif
	<br/>to stockpile : accumuler
	<br/> take a month off : prendre un mois de congé
</details>
<br/>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Simon Ralston</strong> 
	<br/>I manage a small team in finance and there are only five of us. We always talk about what time each of us wants to take off at each holiday season, so the new rules won't change anything for us. I think as long as we understand our responsabilities as employees, then there's never a problem. 
</summary>
<strong></strong>
<i>
	<br/>to take off : décoller (fam.)
</details>
<br/>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Emma Brookes</strong> 
	<br/>I have family that live in Australia so I like to go there once a year for a whole month. Two weeks is just too short for such a long trip. I've taken January off the last two years running and it's never caused a problem before in my department. I think this new rule is unfair on sales people like me who have families that live so far away. 
</summary>
<strong></strong>
<i>
	<br/>I have family that live : accord pluriel
	<br/>two years running : deux années à la suite
	<br/>unfair on sales people : injuste pour les commerciaux
