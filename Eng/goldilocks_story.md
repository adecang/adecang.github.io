## Goldilocks and the Three Bears

Source : DLTK's Crafts for Kids

Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. One day she went for a walk in the forest.  Pretty soon, she came upon a house. This house belonged to three bears but she did not know that. They had just gone out for a short walk before breakfast so there was no-one in. She knocked and, when[^1] no one answered, she walked right in[^2].

At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge[^3], a large one, a medium one and a tiny one. There were also three spoons: a large spoon, a medium spoon and a tiny spoon. Goldilocks was hungry so she was tempted to eat some porridge.

She tasted the porridge from[^4] the large bowl.

"This porridge is too hot!” she exclaimed.

So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.

"This porridge is too cold," she said.

So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.

"Ahhh, this porridge is just right," she said happily and she ate it all up[^5].

After she'd eaten she decided she was feeling a little tired.  So, she walked into the living room where she saw three armchairs.  Goldilocks sat in the first armchair to rest[^6] her feet.  

"This armchair is too big!" she exclaimed.

So she sat in the second armchair.

"This armchair is too hard!" she whined[^7].

So she tried the last and smallest armchair.

"Ahhh, this armchair is just right," she sighed[^8]. But just as she settled down into the armchair to rest, it broke into pieces and she fell down!

By this time Goldilocks was very tired so she went upstairs to the bedroom.  She lay down[^9] in the first bed, but it was too hard.  Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft.  Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right.  Goldilocks fell asleep right away.

As she was sleeping, the three bears came home.

"Someone's been eating my porridge," growled[^10] the Papa bear.

"Someone's been eating my porridge," said the Mama bear.

"Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!" cried the Baby bear.

"Someone's been sitting in my chair," growled the Papa bear.

"Someone's been sitting in my chair," said the Mama bear.

"Someone's been sitting in my chair and they[^11]'ve broken it all to pieces," cried the Baby bear.

They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled, "Someone's been sleeping in my bed!,"

"Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too!" said the Mama bear.

"Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!" exclaimed Baby bear.

Just then, Goldilocks woke up and saw the three bears.  She screamed, "Help!"  and she jumped up and ran out of the room.  Goldilocks ran down the stairs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest.  And she never returned to the home of the three bears.
