###  Beales looks for a buyer

*Radio 4 - Six o'clock news, 12 January 2020*

One of Britain's oldest department store chains has warned that it could collapse into administration. Beales which began trading in Bournemouth in 1881 said a thousand jobs would be at stake if it could not find a buyer. The company is negociating with its landlords to try to secure rent reductions. Here's our business correspondant Rob Young.

*Rob Young:* It's a brutal time for retailers. Debenham began closing nineteen shops yesterday, Mothercare stopped trading today. Now Beales which has twenty-two branches across the country including in Bournemouth, Peterborough and Southport has said it may have to appoint administrators.

The company is negociating with landlords over rent and is talking to two potential buyers: another retailer and a venture capital investor. Managers are hopeful a deal can be done.

The company made a loss of three million pounds in the last financial year. Beales has been around for almost one hundred and forty years but poorer than expected Christmas trading threatens its survival. Even if its immediate future can be assured, store closures aren't being ruled out with a risk to jobs.

The British Retail Consortium said last year was the high street's worst on record. Stores want the government to urgently reform the system of business rates and argue that online retailers are given an unfair advantage.
