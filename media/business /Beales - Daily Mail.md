One of Britain's oldest department stores  Beales has warned it could collapse into administration - putting jobs  at risk unless it can find a buyer. The Bournemouth-based group revealed 1,000 jobs could be lost as it tries to negotiate rent cuts with landlords. It comes after the company brought in advisers at KPMG to lead a strategic review and explore different refinancing options last month. The firm may have to call in administrators after weaker trading than expected over the festive period.

Chief Executive Tony Brown told the [Daily Echo](https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/18154704.beales-set-go-administration-within-days-unless-sale-agreed/): 'We are confident that we have a solution for the business that will create a stronger if leaner Beales. It is difficult trading on the high street. The difficulties are exacerbated by the lunacy of the business rates system.'

Beales, which sells brands including Jimmy Choo and Paul Smith, has been in talks with two hopeful buyers, according to the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51083396).

The company floated on the London stock exchange in 1995 but was returned to private ownership under Mr Brown in October 2018. Mr Brown launched a strategy overhaul in early 2019 to revamp the  department store ranges, which the company said is showing 'significant  sales improvements'. But the retail sector - and department store chains in particular - is being hit hard by tough trading conditions. Debenhams saw its lenders seize control of the company in April following its collapse into administration. 

Beales, which was founded in 1881 by John Elmes Beale, employs around 1,300  staff and another 300 in concessions across its 22 stores. The news is the latest crisis to hit the high street after it was revealed Mothercare is no more. All 79 Mothercare stores are set to close by the end of the week - putting 2,500 people out of work. The mother and baby retailer was selling off its remaining stock with huge discounts of up to 80 per cent available.
