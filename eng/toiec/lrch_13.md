	<br/>You could say that I'm the one working behind the screen. Literally, in some cases. A lot of people don't know, don't care what is happening inside the computer and certainly don't know the difference between a PCI and a CPU. That is, until it breaks down, that's where I come in.

<strong>Talk 2</strong>
	<br/>My work involves the design of new models. Do people want a more compact model, or a bigger screen? How do we give people more power and the same autonomy? What will stand out in one of the most competitive industries in the world? I have to be able to answer those questions and come up with something that meets those requirements.

	<br/>Almost every electronic product on the market today uses silicon wafers. The technology requires a dust-free environment where robots move these tiny fragile slices along the production line to become parts of computers, smartphones and TVs. And we, the workers, wear white bunny suits to cut down the risks of contamination.

	<br/>I'd get nowhere without my phone. You might as well ask me to leave a limb at home. It's my watch, my dictionary, my encyclopeadia, my payment card, my window on the world and my way of finding my way around town. And failing that, calling an Uber. And when its battery runs low, I care for it like a sick child.

	<br/>My mobile is just a phone. I don't ever touch screen, it does'nt have a web browser or three million apps. If I want to send a text message, I have to press '1' three times to get a C. It can last for days without needing recharging and the sound quality is just fine most of the time. I don't need it to do any more than that.

<strong>Talk 6</strong>
	<br>In my job I need to have two screens. As a graphic designer I might be editing a photo on one screen that I need to put into a diagram on the second screen. It reduces the risk of passing over things by not being able to see all of the project at the same time.

### Track 89 - Jade

I think it's difficult for adults to understand that computers is the world the next generation have grown up in. They have never been without the internet and to try to limit their use of it is a losing battle. Our first port of call whenever we need information is our phones or our laptops, so we are setting the example. All we can do is try to make sure they are careful with their use of social media and the potential dangers that lie behind some chat forums. 

### Track 90 - Tony

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_90.mp3)

I try to limit my own use of the internet. It's a rabbit hole where you can spend all night looking at kitten videos if you want to. There's so much more to see and do in the world. I think that rather than trying to convince children not to use their smartphones, you have to show them what incredible things there are to discover in the real world, and then maybe they will feel the need to fill a gap in their lives by tuning to a virtual universe.  

*a rabbit hole : un terrier (de lapin)  
a kitten: un chaton  
to fill a gap: combler un manque*

### Track 91 - Delilah

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_91.mp3)

I think we are not far enough down the line to know the potential dangers of spending almost half the day in front of a screen. And that's not just for children either. Twenty years ago we didn't have smartphones, tablets and laptops in every home. It was as new for us as it was for children. I don't think that looking at a Picasso in an art gallery is the equivalent of seeing it on a screen. It may be difficult for parents to reduce their children's screen time but I think it is our responsability to do it.

although: bien que  
even though: même si  
I had to quit running. I enjoyed it, though : pourtant, cependant  
Therefore: de ce fait, en conséquence  
Despite: malgré  
In spite of : en dépit de, malgré  
Despite his **being** new in the company, Pete has managed to move up rapidly : bien que Pete soit nouveau...

### Filling the gaps in a sentence

1. **Even though** we tend to trust new technology, few companies are truly paperless.
2. The board have decided to outsource IT, **therefore** we may be facing some lay-offs.
3. We all need training on the new software, **despite** it supposedly **being** user friendly and intuitive.
4. **Although** we appreciate the firm giving us smartphones, we are now effectively at work 24/7.

### Track 92 - Carlos's talk

[Audio](Audio/lrtk_92.mp3)

I've been working in IT and product development for the last ten years which has to be one of the most exciting periods in the history of the IT industry. We've gone in a very short space of time from dial-up connections to ADSL , then broadband with fiber optic cables and wifi in terms of internet connections. And that change has pushed the devices to become more and more sophisticated with each change. Today's devices require higher speeds than were available when I started out, and we've been constantly looking to produce products that can make full use of the network we have today, and the network we think we'll have in the near future.

The smartphone, as opposed to a mobile phone, was the beginning of the revolution in devices. To have a phone that is actually more of a mini-computer with a phone function is a huge change from what we had before which was effectively a phone with a few basic computer functions. That of course led to the explosion in the tablet market and more recently phablets, the mix of a phone and a tablet. Today's market is consequently based on apps, the most recent being payment options whereby you no longer need a credit card to pay for items, you just use the app on your smartphone.

But this is not really a jump forward, more an extension of what we already have. My feeling is that although we are still going further with the technology we have, that there is still another big jump forward out there for us to find. So the big question is, what comes next? And that is where the race is really on. It's like the race to the moon in the sixties. We all know that there is a next step, and there are a few ideas about what it might be, but how to achieve it is the challenge, and whoever does it first will have their very own 'one small step for a man' moment.

The smart money is an hologram technology. That's to say your device will be a hologram projector and therefore you interact with a hologram instead of a screen. It follows the general trend of the last few years : devices are getting smaller, thinner and more powerful at the same time. Hologram technology would allow your device to be even smaller, saving space to make the size of the screen literally as big or as small as you want it to be.

Right now, this is a concept which belongs to science fiction, just as the internet and the mobile phone were inconceivable a generation ago. What we've discovered in my time in the business is that nothing is impossible. The sky really is the limit, and tomorrow's world is getting closer by the minute.

*dial-up connection : connection téléphonique (avec un modem, technologie disparue)  
broadband: le haut débit (avec la fibre optique)  
a device: un appareil  
a race: une course  
Whoever: qui que ce soit  
"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind" : Armstrong when he first stepped on the moon on July 21 1969.  
The sky really is the limit: il n'y a pas de limites, les perspectives sont illimitées*

* I will leave tomorrow: décision prise au moement où je parle  
* I'm leaving tomorrow: c'est prévu  
* I'm going to leave: c'est prévu et j'insiste sur ma décision (c'est une nuance)  
* The conference begins at 7: fait objectif, information tirée d'un planning, d'un horaire etc.

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Conversation D</strong>
	<br/>— Do you know the site? The prices look good but I've never used them before.

</summary>
	<br/>6: I don't know if you can trust all the sites online.
<i>
	<br/>a scam: une escroquerie, une fraude

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Conversation E</strong>
	<br/>— — Have you seen the price of these books? They're free delivery too.
	<br/>— Yeah, well, that's why our local bookstore is closing down. They can't compete with the internet and I want to support my local businesses.

</summary>
	<br/>3: Some services only exist online.
<i>
	<br/>a deal: une affaire
</i>
</details>
<br/>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Conversation G</strong>
	<br/>— This website has some fantastic offers. It's so much cheaper than at the mall. Some of the prices in town are just a rip-off.
	<br/>— Maybe. But all it needs is one hacker to get your credit card number and he'll empty your bank account.
</summary>
	<br/>2: I prefer not tu use my credit card on the internet.

</details>
<br/>

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Conversation H</strong>
	<br/>— I had a look at this washing machine in the stores and they had the same one online for twenty percent less. It really is a steal.
	<br/>— It's a good deal all right. But what do you do if it needs repairing in six months' time?
</summary>
	<br/>8: You don't have the same aftersales service.
