Here's the full transcript of Trump's comments:

> "So I asked Bill a question some of you are thinking of if you're into that world, which I find to be pretty interesting. So, supposing we hit the  body with a tremendous, whether its ultraviolet or just very powerful  light, and I think you said, that hasn't been checked but you're gonna  test it. And then I said, supposing it brought the light inside the  body, which you can either do either through the skin or some other way, and I think you said you're gonna test that too, sounds interesting.  **And I then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute, and is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside,  or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs, and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it'd be interesting to check that.**  So you're going to have to use medical doctors, but it sounds  interesting to me, so we'll see. But the whole concept of the light, the way it goes in one minute, that's pretty powerful."
