Hi, my names's Katie, and I'm originally from Leeds, in Yorkshire, and I've been living in France now for nearly six years.

So, the confinement, yes, it's different. Here in France obviously we need to have a piece of paper or we can now download it on our phones to have a reason to go out and so I think it does make you think about, do you really need to get that thing, do you really have to go out, and I think people are much more aware of being in close proximity to other people.

I think what I find most difficult is - I'm also a teacher so working and also making sure my own children are able to do their schoolwork - I feel quite sorry for them actually that they can't see their friends and they can't do their usual things that they would normally do, their activities and sports etc, but they're doing ok.

I guess for us confinement's not too bad in the sense that we have a nice big garden, we have lots of space so I don't feel as claustrophobic maybe as - I can imagine if you lived in a very small apartment and you'd got no outer space, it must feel even worse.

In contrast to my family back in England I think France is maybe a little bit stricter with the rules. I do see and watch the news in the UK and I see things from friends and family on social media and I - they are on lockdown but I don't feel like -it doesn't seem as strict actually as here in France and I still see people who keep going running for miles and miles whereas here in France you're only supposed to go within a one kilometer radius. I don't know if that means that we're taking it more seriously here or if there really is a difference but that's how it seems.

2:30

On another note, I do go running every few days, I feel it's important really to -for my mental health and just to have maybe half an hour on my own, just to get out. It's a bit different now because I'm having  to obviously run around town because we live in town. Normally I would like to go off to the woods or run much further. But I feel I do need it to - sometimes it justs help me get through the day or to feel like I'm being active and I'm not just sitting around in front of Netflix.

But this is four weeks into the lockdown and it's ok so far. It's the school holidays now so we might feel more relaxed for a few weeks but maybe if you ask me again in another four weeks I might be telling you a different story.
